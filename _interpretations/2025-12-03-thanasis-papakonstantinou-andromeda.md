title: "Interpretation of “Andromeda” by Thanasis Papakonstantinou"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Andromeda'."
---

In this entry, I interpret one of my favourite songs from the works of
songmaker Thanasis Papakonstantinou. _Andromeda_ is a joy to listen to
even if you do not pay attention to the lyrics or, indeed, understand
a word of Greek: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H8uvGJBSkM>. The
instrumentation alone is awesome.

This is how I experience these songs. They engender feelings, subject
to the prevailing conditions. Only once I appreciate them at the level
of aesthetics do I attempt to parse them with a cooler head. At that
point, I am reducing the phenomenon to a matter of reasonableness.
"Reduce" is the operative term. My interpretations are taking
something away from the totality of the lived moment for the sake of
making a commentary that has applications beyond the confines of art.

Below are the original lyrics, my faithful translation of them, and
some further commentary on what I think the meaning is.

Ανδρομέδα

Ερμηνεία:  Θανάσης Παπακωνσταντίνου
Στίχοι:    Θανάσης Παπακωνσταντίνου
Μουσική:   Θανάσης Παπακωνσταντίνου


Άιντε μες της γης το πυρωμένο κέντρο
άιντε δυο πουλιά φιλιούνται σ'ένα δέντρο
Άιντε πέφτει λάβα, λάβα απ'τα φιλιά τους
άιντε και φτερά απολιθωμένα απ'τα κορμιά τους

Άιντε εκεί μακριά, μακριά στην Ανδρομέδα
άιντε πίνουν τσίπουρο και τρων λακέρδα
Άιντε κάτι όντα περίεργα κι ωραία
άιντε που είναι μόνα και ψάχνουν για παρέα

Άιντε εκεί ψηλά στην άκαρπη Μελούνα
άιντε φύτρωσε, φύτρωσε μια παπαρούνα
Άιντε που'χει στόμα, στόμα και δαγκάνει
άιντε κι όλο λέει πως δεν το ξανακάνει

Άιντε εκεί βαθιά, βαθιά στα σωθικά μου
άιντε κάτι γίνεται κυρά μου
Άιντε χίλια άλογα τυφλά γυρίζουν
άιντε έξοδο ζητάν και μ'αλωνίζουν

Άιντε εδώ σιμά κοντά δυο μέτρα βάθος
άιντε λεν πως φυλακίζουνε το πάθος
Άιντε ρίχνουν χώμα, με λουλούδια ραίνουν
άιντε και θαρρούν, θαρρούν πως ξεμπερδεύουν

Andromeda

Singer:  Thanasis Papakonstantinou
Lyrics:  Thanasis Papakonstantinou
Music:   Thanasis Papakonstantinou


Hey in the earth's fiery centre
hey two birds kiss on a tree
Hey lava flows, lava from their kisses
hey and fossilised feathers from their bodies

Hey there far, far in Andromeda
hey they drink tsipouro and eat lakerda
Hey some beings strange and nice
hey who are alone and seek company

Hey there high at fruitless Melouna
hey sprung, sprung a poppy
Hey which has a mouth, a mouth that bites
hey and says it will not do it again

Hey there deep, deep in my guts
hey something is happening my lady
Hey a thousand blind horses roam
hey they seek an exit and flatten me

Hey near here about two metres deep
hey they say they imprison the passion
Hey they throw soil, with flowers they decorate
hey and believe, believe they are done with it
```

The artist masterfully takes us through the highs and lows of the
Earth all the way to the furthest stretches of the universe. There is
something to be said about the depths of the planet, the reality in
Andromeda, the changing circumstances at the Greek highlands, and the
facts in the immediate milieu of the poetic first person.

What all these magnitudes have in common is their presence on a
continuum of life. The cosmos is consistent throughout. It exhibits
pattern and structure, it is underpinned by computation, it sustains
feedback loops of cause and effect, and therein it creates what
effectively is communication and thus language. Why does this
consistency matter? Because it makes the experiences of one person
relatable. We can tell what passion is like. And we may feel for those
Andromedan folk who are lonely and seek company, even though we have
never met them.

The hope, then, of the poetic first person is to communicate the
feeling of attraction to the third person of the song, who is
described as a lady. The "I" is in love though is facing certain
unnamed constraints which make a potential relationship unlikely or,
indeed, prohibitive. The last verse gives us a clue about the "should
not" norms that prevail and how individuals there suppress their
feelings while pretending nothing is happening.

To the author this state of affairs must be strange, given that love
is age-old and ubiquitous. This is why we learn about the fossils and
then the creatures of the far away galaxy who are ultimately like us.
We also hear about the barren hills of Melouna, a place in central
Greece, where even there we find something fecund and, thus, realise
the potential for new beginnings out of existing ones.

Ultimately, _Andromeda_, carries a straightforward message: "I like
you, so if you like me let us not overthink it, my lady, because this
is how it is everywhere and has always been".

To my mind, love is simple and it never hurts. What is difficult, and
what ultimately can cause trouble, is everything else around it. Love
brings people together from where arises the need to manage shared
resources. This is now a matter of economics, not benevolent feelings.
The word "economy" comes from the Greek terms for house (οίκος) and
law or rule more broadly (νόμος). Wherever many agents of action deal
with their affairs in concert, there are emergent patterns of
behaviour for accessing, distributing, and using the available
resources.

We then understand why we are sometimes willing to hide our wants:
they can be inconvenient. To have a child or not, for example, is an
economic decision with far-reaching implications. This is true in
agrarian societies whose mode of production is a function of land and
manual labour. Families must have lots of children because they need
the extra pairs of hands. It is also true in the modern industrialised
and digitised world even though the forces at play are different: the
society still needs injections of youth to fund the social safety net,
to care for the elderly, to run businesses, to do all the work that
cannot be automated, and to be consumers.

Yes, there is love and caring and the joy of having kids, but those
cannot operate outside the ironclad laws that govern scarcity. For
most people in the part of world Thanasis Papakonstantinou comes from,
the decision to have a child comes at a high cost. The mother will,
for example, take time off work and, perhaps, give up on her career
altogether. Materially this is doable, especially if those involved
are willing to change their ways and adjust their expectations. Though
it is culturally out of fashion.

Perhaps, then, the poetic "I" is at odds with the underlying values of
this culture that prioritise the career aspect, its derivative trends,
and ideological underpinnings. Those are jobs which typically are
bureaucratic in nature and all-too-often complete bullshit in their
utility. Yet they somehow take priority over sociocultural
rejuvenation. So here we are, overthinking the simple things, making
the natural controversial, and decorating our graves in the process.
