title: "Interpretation of “Must” (Of course we mustn't) by Vicky Moscholiou"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Must'."
---

For this entry I have picked a beautiful old Greek song which was
originally performed by Vicky Moscholiou (Βίκυ Μοσχολιού).  Here is a
decent recording I could find: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS3f5ITOfnQ>.

Also check the masterful cover by Socratis Malamas (Σωκράτης Μάλαμας):
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjxJIysFyg> (I prefer this one because
I love his voice).

Below are the lyrics, my translation of them, and philosophical
commentary.

```
Πρέπει (Ασφαλώς και δεν πρέπει)

Ερμηνεία:  Βίκυ Μοσχολιού
Στίχοι:    Άκης Πάνου
Μουσική:   Άκης Πάνου


Ασφαλώς και δεν πρέπει να μας δούνε παρέα
Επεράσαμε ωραία λίγες ώρες μαζί
Είναι η πρώτη μας νύχτα, πρώτη και τελευταία
Ασφαλώς και δεν πρέπει να μας δούνε παρέα

Ασφαλώς και το ξέρω πως δεν είμαστε ίδια
Μοναχά στα παιχνίδια είμαστε όλοι παιδιά
Και αν εσύ το ξεχάσεις η ζωή στο θυμίζει
Και πεθαίνει η αγάπη και σωπαίνει η καρδιά

Είμαι εκείνη που είμαι και έχεις όνομα κάποιο
Σε χρυσό κόσμο σάπιο δε χωράω να μπω
Κάνε εκείνο που πρέπει, όλα τα επιτρέπει
Το δικό σου το πρέπει ένα πρέπει θαμπό
```

```
Must (Of course it musn't)

Singer:  Vicky Moscholiou
Lyrics:  Akis Panou
Music:   Akis Panou


Of course we musn't be seen together
Had a good time for a few hours together
It is our first night, first and last
Of course we musn't be seen together

Of course I know we aren't the same
Only in games everybody is a child
And if you forget it life reminds you
And love dies and the heart remains silent

I am who I am and you have a certain name
In a golden rotten world I can't fit in
Do what you must, it allows everything
Your must is a blurred must
```

The apparent message of this song is that of forbidden love, of an
affair that cannot materialise under the prevailing circumstances.
Though there is nothing particularly erotic or romantic in the lyrics.
They are but a description of how norms, roles, and social
stratification or segregation work.

[ Read/watch: [Expectations, rules, and
role-playing](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-05-03-expectations-rules-roles/) ]

Each person has their status.  It is not about the person, but the
institution.  Prince William is not William.  The actual human being
does not matter all that much.  The focus is on the office and how the
person performs in accordance with its demands.  And if William forgets,
life (i.e. others) will remind him that he is _the_ Prince.

Either we conform with our role or have to escape from its grip.  To
rebel successfully or die trying.  Else we embody the institution: we
become the bundle of all those "must" and "must not" that are fastened
upon the cultural construct we represent.

[ Read/watch [On insecurity, confidence, and
aloofness](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-08-25-insecurity-confidence-aloofness/) ]

How class or caste can divide people is quite clear.  Though consider
other types of relationships that suffer from discrimination and
prejudice, such as a person from a deeply theistic community loving an
atheist, instances of homosexuality, a foreigner in a racist milieu...
"Of course it mustn't" happen because the prevailing values and
traditions demand otherwise.

Values and traditions do not speak, have no opinion, and no means by
which to carry out actions.  These are ideas that are shared by people
and only become actualised through the behaviour of those individuals.
They are preserved, substantiated, and enforced intersubjectively.

The "must" or "mustn't" are products of institution: the process of
enacting concepts as enforceable rules.  The social whole applies its
notions and works for their preservation or proliferation.  Through this
mechanism, the effective emergent organism reproduces itself in the form
of intergenerational representations, else culture.  Seen in macroscopic
terms, this happens organically.

To institute is to set apart an opinion and exalt it as the right one.
Not in a spirit of openness, but as a matter of favouring a certain view
of the world.  The instituted reality necessarily is opinionated and
resistant to counterpoints.

[ Read/watch: [Conventions, relativism, and
cosmopolitanism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-02-21-relativism-cosmopolitanism/) ]

It is common for private choices or group behaviours to be justified by
the presence of certain institutions.  Values and traditions serve as
the indisputable authority that people invoke in support of their deeds.
When someone appeals to authority, they are not really interested in
deliberation.  They have no intent to cooperate in a joint pursuit to
figure out what the truth is.  The authority is absolute.  The "must" or
"mustn't" tolerates no alternatives.

Especially in so-called "Western" countries, we can been conditioned to
think that these sort of issues do not exist.  We believe we have
perfectly open societies that simply tolerate everything.  Love
everywhere!  Yet hidden behind that facade of superficial "progress" are
deep-seated biases and simmering culture wars.

Every society comes with a latent capacity of intolerance and
totalitarianism.  Those who think otherwise, those who hope that some
constitution or legal document will by itself safeguard fundamental
rights are naive.  What is instituted, is continuously affirmed.  What
is instituted can be reinstituted.  Freedoms can be rolled back.
Absolutism may be established as the new normal.  A civilisation
declines when its members grow complacent.

The specifics of the forbidden love, then, are a reminder of what the
effective instituted reality is at any given moment.  Going by its
precepts, we mustn't proceed.  But why should we provide assent to them,
anyway?  Let love speak.  Enough with the "must"!
