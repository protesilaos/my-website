title: "Interpretation of “God himself” by Blé (Giorgia Kefalá)"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'God Himself'."
---

For this entry in the series I pick a banger of a hit from the _Blé_
(Μπλε) band: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx33Ef57iJc>. This is
the best version of the song I have found online. The audio quality is
top notch and the performance is passionate.

Below are the original lyrics in Greek, my faithful translation, and
some comments on what I make of them.

```
Τον ίδιο το Θεό

Ερμηνεία:  Μπλε, Τζώρτζια Κεφαλά
Στίχοι:    Γιώργος Παρώδης
Μουσική:   Γιώργος Παπαποστόλου


Πάνω σου η γη ξυπνάει
Ήλιος μπαίνει από παντού
Κάθομαι και σε κοιτάζω μη με φοβάσαι

Είσαι ακόμα από τον ύπνο
Τ'όνειρο έχει εξατμιστεί
Μάρτιο θυμίζεις, πώς να σε προβλέψω;

Ένα απ'όλα τα βιβλία
Που έχω μέσα μου βαθιά
Του έρωτα φεγγάρια μαύρα το φωτίζουν

Τίποτα δεν έχει μείνει
Κι όμως όλα είναι εδώ
Άφησε με να αγγίξω τα μαλλιά σου

Τον ίδιο το Θεό
να είχα απέναντι μου
σου λέω προτιμώ
στην κόλαση μαζί σου

Άφωνη η ζωή ρωτάει
«Τόση ομορφιά από πού;»
Βρέχει ο ουρανός ρουμπίνια κι απαντάει

«Μόνο η αγάπη ξέρει»
Τώρα έμαθα κι εγώ
πόσο ανάγκη έχω από την αγκαλιά σου

Τον ίδιο το Θεό
να είχα απέναντι μου
σου λέω προτιμώ
στην κόλαση μαζί σου

Τίποτα άλλο εκτός
από εσένα στο φως
Τίποτα άλλο που να με σκοτώνει γλυκά
```

```
God himself

Singer:  Blé, Giorgia Kefalá
Lyrics:  Giorgos Parodis
Music:   Giorgos Papapostolou


The earth awakens over you
Sunshine enters from everywhere
I sit staring at you do not fear me

You are still asleep
The dream has evaporated
You evoke March, how can I predict you?

One among all the books
That I have deep inside of me
Love's dark moons are luminating it

Nothing is left
Yet everything is here
Let me touch your hair

God himself
had I in front of me
I tell you I prefer
to be with you in hell

Speechless life asks
"Whence all this beauty?"
The sky rains rubies and responds

"Love only knows"
Now I know as well
how much need I have for your hug

God himself
had I in front of me
I tell you I prefer
to be with you in hell

Nothing else except
you in the light
Nothing else that is killing me sweetly
```

This song is a recognition of---and appreciation for---imperfection.
It invites us to keep things simple in accepting what we have. There
is beauty to be experienced if we are willing to work for it, provided
we do not fall in the trap of seeking perfection.

The poetic "you" is a flawed lover. They remind the first person of
the notoriously temperamental month of March: sometimes scorching hot,
at others icy cold. Oscillations between the extremes can be difficult
to handle. This lover does have redeeming, even admirable, qualities
though: it is why our protagonist has evidently fallen in love with
them. The point, then, is not that the lover is erratic but that this
fact poses no impediment whatsoever to the relationship.

One's attitude is of paramount importance. The poetic "I" exhibits the
necessary maturity to make things work by trying in earnest, despite
admitting that this relationship is a drain on them. The frailties of
character, the contentious parts, are qualities that every person and,
by extension, every relationship exhibits. To entertain the typically
false belief that the grass is greener elsewhere is to never be
satisfied with anyone or anything.

Be constructive and supportive, while still drawing boundaries. Yet
refrain from the self-fulfilling negativity of seeking triggers for
anger, frustration, and petty complaints. Give and take gracefully
without wanting to be the boss. The expectation to control the other,
be it through physical coercion, emotional manipulation, or financial
restrictions is what renders the relationship lopsided and abusive.

Admitting to one's own mistakes is equally important. Otherwise it
comes off as insecure, while being patronising and hypocritical.
Whenever you catch yourself telling your lover in a belittling tone
how to be a better person look in the mirror and ask what you could
have done differently to set them up for success.

Sometimes the problems are insurmountable. It takes courage to
recognise as much and seek a resolution. What this song reminds us is
to not be trigger-happy: try to the best of your abilities before quitting.
