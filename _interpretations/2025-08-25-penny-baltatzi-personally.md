title: "Interpretation of “Personally” by Penny Baltatzi"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Personally'."
---

For this entry in the series, I have selected a beautiful song that I
can best describe as "straightforwardly erotic":
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWjha97vCf0>. It is a modern
rendition of _Personally_, that was originally performed by Eleni
Dimou (Ελένη Δήμου). The singer is Penny Baltatzi, who is also known
for her Swing- and Latin- inspired contributions to the domestic music
scene.

Below are the lyrics in Greek, my literal translation of them, and
some further philosophical comments.

Προσωπικά

Ερμηνεία:  Πέννυ Μπαλτατζή
Στίχοι:    Λίνα Νικολακοπούλου
Μουσική:   Γιάννης Σπανός


Προσωπικά, δεν έχω αισθήματα για σένα φιλικά
μονάχα βήματα θιγμένα ερωτικά
που μ'αναγκάζουνε να φεύγω βιαστικά

Προσωπικά, δε θέλω τίποτα μαζί σου λογικά
μου πάει ο ήχος της φωνής σου τραγικά
και δεν αλλάζω το κορμί σου με την άψογη ζωή σου τελικά

Προσωπικά, εγώ τρελαίνομαι
το παραμύθι σου και να'μαι και να φαίνομαι
Προσωπικά δεν έχω αίσθηση
αυτό που ζούμε αν είναι αλήθεια ή παραίσθηση

Προσωπικά, τυχαίνει βράδια με τραγούδια λαϊκά
ντυμένη κι άδεια κι αφημένη γενικά
να μεταφράζω τη σκηνή δραματικά

Προσωπικά, εμένα ο χρόνος μου γυρίζει κυκλικά
κι αλλάζει ο τόνος μου στο τέλος ειδικά
γι'αυτό να ξέρεις κι επιμένω, κι ας μου το'χεις ξεγραμμένο οριστικά
```

Personally

Singer:   Penny Baltatzi
Lyrics:   Lina Nikolakopoulou
Music:    Yiannis Spanos


Personally, I have no friendly feelings for you
only steps touched erotically
that force me to flee hastily

Personally, I want nothing with you logically
the sound of your voice suits me tragically
and I do not change your body with your impeccable life finally

Personally, I lose my mind
to be your tale and to look the part
Personally I have no sense
if what we live is true or hallucination

Personally, it happens at nights with pop songs
dressed and empty and relaxed in general
to interpret the scene dramatically

Personally, my time turns cyclically
and my tone changes towards the end especially
so know and I insist even if you have it forgone definitively
```

As I have noted before in the interpretation of [Just two
days](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2025-04-22-galani-just-two-days/),
the Greek language distinguishes between the phenomena of "falling in
love" and "growing to love" or "love at-large". The former is
described as "eros" (έρως) or "erotas" (έρωτας), which is the name of
the eponymous god. From there we get words like "erotic". Love
at-large is called "agape" (αγάπη): it encompasses feelings of
affection towards family, friends, pets, et cetera. In _Personally_ we
get an honest account of erotic sensation. There is no ambiguity about
it, no hesitation, no mixed signals. The poetic first person is
communicating the essential feeling of erotas, namely, relinquishing
control.

Erotas consists in the targeted suspension of strategising; targeted
towards the object of the erotic expression. It resists planning and
rationalising. It does not pause to ask about social norms,
longer-term goals, potential benefits, and the like. Those are matters
of logistics, of managing resources and of maximising opportunities.
Erotas has a narrow field of application in which it reigns supreme.
It is found in those instances of freedom from care, freedom from
overthinking, such as when all you want is to be within range of your
lover's smile, to discern the look in their eyes which communicates
everything without the need for words or other gestures.

There is a certain playfulness or process of discovery in erotas. It
is why the song mentions the erotically touched steps that seek
flight. This is not about a genuine want for a safe haven. No! It is
how you discover that you are no longer operating in purely rational
terms. Reason is but a facet of the human condition that some thinkers
have mistakenly exalted as the superior human trait. The gods know
better though. They can show us how brittle and misguided our
intellectual superstructures are, such as through the power of
subtlety. What do you feel when you are the sole intended recipient of
that captivating stare? How is it to be strong and decisive, yet
wanting to be treated by that certain one as a vulnerable form of
life?

These questions do not require answers. Erotas is not about arguments
or clever thought experiments. You know it when you feel it, when your
defences are rendered ineffectual and all you do is focus on the
little things: the turn of the head, the formation of that gentle
smile, and the electrifying spark in the eyes. _Personally_ thus
insists on the authenticity of the moment: to transiently lose your
mind and to forgo any desire for power in the relationship. Only then
do you interpret the scene as an ancient Greek drama, an act of fate
and of human design, of the gods making their works manifest through
nuances we are powerless to master.
