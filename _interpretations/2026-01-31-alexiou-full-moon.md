title: "Interpretation of “Full moon” by Haris Alexiou"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Full moon'."
---

For this interpretation I have picked an emotional song from the
legendary Haris Alexiou: <https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=MZQfbcWDP2g>.
_Full moon_, like many of Haris' own writings provides insight into
the emotional world of a woman.

Below are the original lyrics, my faithful translation of them into
English, and further comments on the substantive points.

Πανσέληνος

Ερμηνεία:  Χάρις Αλεξίου
Στίχοι:    Χάρις Αλεξίου
Μουσική:   Χάρις Αλεξίου


Στην μέση ενός μικρού σπιτιού, που'χω νοικιάσει
το γέλιο ενός μωρού παιδιού με έχει αγκαλιάσει
Τα ζήτησα όλα απ'τη ζωή μου, τα πλήρωσα με την ψυχή μου
να έχει ένα τόπο η καρδιά πριν να γεράσει

Μα έχει πανσέληνο απόψε κι είναι ωραία
είναι αλλιώτικη η σιωπή χωρίς παρέα
Δεν νιώθω θλίψη, μα μου’χει λείψει
το κοριτσάκι αυτό που αγάπησες τυχαία
Δεν νιώθω θλίψη, μα μου'χει λείψει
το λάγνο ψέμα σου που τα'κανε όλα ωραία

Είναι σκληρό για μια γυναίκα να'ναι μόνη
στο λέω τώρα που η αλήθεια δε θυμώνει
Όση και να'ναι η δύναμή μου, θέλω έναν άνθρωπο μαζί μου
Η μοναξιά στήνει παγίδες και πληγώνει

Μα έχει πανσέληνο απόψε κι είναι ωραία
το σπίτι μου έρημο μα κάνουμε παρέα
Δεν νιώθω θλίψη, μα μου'χει λείψει
το κοριτσάκι αυτό που αγάπησες τυχαία
Δεν νιώθω θλίψη, μα μου'χει λείψει
το λάγνο ψέμα σου που τα'κανε όλα ωραία
```

Full moon

Singer:  Haris Alexiou
Lyrics:  Haris Alexiou
Music:   Haris Alexiou


In the middle of a tiny house which I rent
the laughter of a baby child has embraced me
I asked for everything from my life, I paid with my soul
for there to be a place for the heart before it gets old

But there is full moon tonight and it is nice
silence is different without company
I feel no grief but I do miss
the young girl you once loved by chance
I feel no grief but I do miss
your lustful lie that made everything nice

It is hard for a woman to be alone
I tell you now that the truth does not cause anger
No matter how much is my strength I want someone with me
Loneliness sets up traps and hurts

But there is full moon tonight and it is nice
my house is deserted but we hang out together
I feel no grief but I do miss
the young girl you once loved by chance
I feel no grief but I do miss
your lustful lie that made everything nice
```

I think of the lyrics as a confession. The poetic first person, who
may well be Haris speaking in earnest, shares with us how she misses
who she used to be. This person from yesterage, the "young girl"
alluded to herein, is not merely a younger version of the protagonist.
It is the one---and only one---who experienced a certain experience:
the love of a specific man. The "young girl", then, is integral to the
story of this mature woman's life, for it is that very girl that
attracted someone special; someone with whom they partook in a shared
experience that only they know the most intimate details of.

In this regard, the reference to the baby child and its laughter is
important for two reasons. Firstly, what we are presented with is the
perspective of a mother. Secondly, the child is the living embodiment
of what happened and a sweet reminder of it.

Love in general is not uncommon. Humanity at-large expresses it in a
multitude of ways. What is unique to each of us though, is the
subjective view of certain instances of love if/when those do happen.
It is all about the particular place and time where the paths of those
involved intersect. According to the song, this convergence was a
matter of chance. Yet such is not a quality that detracts from the
magic of the moment. If anything, it is a contributing factor to it,
for it reminds us how something exceptional can occur in a world of
happenstance.

The confession I discern pertains to the oft suppressed desire for
adventure which is hidden behind an intellectualist facade such as the
typical claim that "I only care about his character". The mention to
the "lustful lie that made everything nice" tells us about both the
burning passion involved in said adventures, erotic as they are, and
also the most blatantly wishful and false belief that fuels them:
"forever".

Feelings of irresistible attraction are transient and short-lived,
much like the full moon. Though we prefer to believe that our case
will somehow be different, even though the odds are stacked against
us. Yes, there are exceptions. It is those rare cases where the lovers
make considerable efforts to fall in love again and again, instead of
letting routine consume the excitement. "Let me tell you about my day"
followed by a series of the same old complaints is how routine asserts
its ugly dominance. What remains is an empty shell of a relationship.

Knowledge of the lie does not inhibit the passions, mind you. We want
to play the game, even if only for a single round. It is why there is
no grief in this song for what has transpired. There are no regrets
either. No bemoaning of the fact untruths were spoken. The poetic "I"
recognises its current pain and gracefully expresses the want for
companionship, with everything that comes with it. Perhaps it is an
admission that another round would be exhilarating. Hindsight, then,
does not inspire us to seek the truth in such affairs but, instead, to
hope for the day when we are told. in a whispering voice, that our
dreams will survive the mornings.
