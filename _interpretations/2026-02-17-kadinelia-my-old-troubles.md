title: "Interpretation of “My old troubles” by Kadinelia"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'My old troubles'."
---

For this entry in the "interpretations" series, I have picked the
remix of a traditional song by _Kadinelia_. _Kadinelia_ is a musical
duo that draws inspiration from many genres, blending them with
ancient motifs to deliver art that is refreshingly new yet
unmistakably familiar.

Their upbeat rendition of _My old troubles_ is a case in point:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lyxHHlX6z0>. There is the guitar and
what sounds to me like elements of American country music, though it
also captures the primordial spirit of a Dionysian festival. Compare
it to a more traditional interpretation, which is also nice in its own
way: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBNAhwaeyss>.

Below are the lyrics, my faithful translation of them, and comments on
the substantive points.

Τα παλαιά μου βάσανα

Ερμηνεία:  Καντινέλια
Στίχοι:    Παραδοσιακό
Μουσική:   Παραδοσιακό


Τα παλαιά μου βάσανα
περά- καλέ περάσανε και πάνε
Τα τωρινά γικήκανε
φιθκιά καλέ φιθκιά για να με φαν

Λελαλε κι αμάν αμάν
τα παλαιά μου βάσανα

Άνθρωπε γλέντα τη ζωή
μην εί- καλέ μην είσαι πλεονέκτης
Γιατί στο χώμα που πατάς
είσαι καλέ είσαι ένας επισκέπτης

Λελαλε κι αμάν αμάν
άνθρωπε γλέντα τη ζωή

Τα βάσανα μου τραγουδώ
τον πό- καλέ τον πόνο μου γλεντίζω
Κι όπως τον εύρω τον καίρο
ετσά καλέ ετσά τον αρμενίζω

Λελαλε κι αμάν αμάν
όπως τον εύρω τον καιρό
```

My old troubles

Singer:  Kadinelia
Lyrics:  Traditional
Music:   Traditional


My old troubles
they pa- dear they passed and they go
My current ones became
snakes dear snakes to eat me

Lelale and aman aman [expressions of joy and woe]
my old troubles

Human enjoy your life
do be dear do not be greedy
Because on the ground you stand on
you are dear you are a guest

Lelale and aman aman
human enjoy your life

I sing my troubles
my pai- dear my pain I enjoy
And however I find the times
thus dear thus I navigate them

Lelale and aman aman
however I find the times
```

This song is a celebration of flow and lightness. It is about not
dwelling on what has transpired: letting go of the past woes and
success stories to deal with the prevailing conditions as they unfold.
The prerequisite is to understand that you do not take anything with
you. Not the good parts. Not the bad ones. Time is inexorable. It goes
by and you are powerless to stop it. What once defined you is taken
away before your eyes, sometimes in tiny increments, at others in
large chunks.

Flow is about dealing with the world as-is. Learn from the past, but
do not remain preoccupied with it. Bring to the present the parts that
are relevant and forgo the rest. There is no going back to rectify
your mistakes. It is impossible to replay those states of affairs,
giving you the opportunity to do things differently. Whatever
lingering doubts or regrets about a world that no longer exists are
forever burdensome. Same principle for the future. It is common to
invest all your hopes in some potential outcome that is not a direct
consequence of your deeds. You anticipate it, thinking that it will
finally deliver to you all you ever desired. If that happens, it turns
out that you actually wanted something else. And if it does not
happen, the meantime is spent ignoring or bemoaning your condition.
Your attention span has shifted away from the immediate circumstances,
making it almost impossible to appreciate what is available to you.

Lightness is the emotional state you have once you start going with
the flow. You recognise that experiences belong to their place and
time. As such, you do not make an attempt at clinging on to them. They
stay, but you continue. Life is a little bit like travelling the world
on foot. All you have is a backpack with provisions. Your physical
limitations mean that you cannot afford to carry anything else, no
matter how much your heart desires it. And if you commit the mistake
of putting more weight on your shoulders than what is sustainable, you
will experience unending torment.

_Kadinelia_ invites you to change how you deal with negative feelings.
What someone said about you is often inconsequential. Yet if you keep
revolving around it, doubting your abilities, and loathing your self
for not being good enough, then the negativity gets amplified. It
becomes a force so preponderant that it makes you act in a disjointed
fashion.

Singing and dancing, among other physical activities, are effective
remedies for overthinking. It is no coincidence that Dionysos
(Dionysus) is more than just the god of festivities: he is also
related to reanimation, resurrection, and rebirth. By participating in
the festival or, more generally, by getting "out of your head" you do
something in zest. It is engrossing and immersive. We call such
activities "recreational" because they effectively reinvigorate us,
remaking us as it were.

The challenge, then, is to find joy in what is in your milieu. Start
with the little things. Pay close attention to them. Take note of what
you think their positive qualities are. If it is only negatives you
notice, make it a challenge to come up with a better design for at
least some of them. How would you improve them? Try that in earnest.
The very work on such a project is already channelling your vitality
towards something other than the negativity you had discerned.

The general idea is to work on your situational awareness. To be able
to describe what is around you and how you feel in the moment. This
empowers you to quickly spot the aspects of the world that can have a
benign effect on you. Whatever you do though, remember that you are
but a guest on this earth. Do what you must while you can. And do not
take yourself too seriously.
