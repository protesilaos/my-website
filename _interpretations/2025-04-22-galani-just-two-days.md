excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Just two days'."
---

The subject of this entry is an erotic and inspiring song by Dimitra Galani (Δήμητρα
Γαλάνη) titled _Just two days_: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ByBDFDvqmI>.

Below are the original lyrics, my faithful translation of them, and
then some comments on the substantive point.

```
Δυο μέρες μόνο

Ερμηνεία:  Δήμητρα Γαλάνη
Στίχοι:    Παρασκευάς Καρασούλος
Μουσική:   Δήμητρα Γαλάνη


Δυο μέρες μόνο
Να σε κρατάω αγκαλιά
Δυο μέρες μόνο
Να σ'έχω δίπλα μου ξανά
Για λίγο μόνο

Δυο μέρες μόνο
Σ'ένα ταξίδι αστραπή
Να ξεδιπλώνω
Να παίρνει ανάσα η ζωή
Για λίγο μόνο

Για τόσο μόνο
Φως να γεμίζουν οι στιγμές
Να λάμπουν μες στο χρόνο
Όλο το σώμα μου να ζει
Για σένα μόνο

Δυο μέρες μόνο
Να συνηθίζει το κορμί
Κι εγώ να λιώνω
Έπειτα μόνο τη φωνή σου
Ν'ανταμώνω

Δυο μέρες μόνο
Όσο μια βόλτα διαρκεί
Για τόσο μόνο
Όλη η ζωή μου
Αυτή η στιγμή
Δυο μέρες μόνο
```

Just two days

Singer:   Dimitra Galani
Lyrics:   Paraskevas Karasoulos
Music:    Dimitra Galani


Just two days
To hold you in my embrace
Just two days
To have you beside me again
Just for a little while

Just two days
On a lightning trip
To be unfolding
Life to be taking a breath
Just for a little while

Just for that long
Moments to be filling with light
To be shining in time
My entire body to be living
Just for you

Just two days
The body to be adapting
And me be melting
Then only your voice
to be encountering

Just two days
As much as a stroll lasts
Just for that long
My entire life
This very moment
Just two days
```

In Greek we disambiguate the concept of _falling in love_ from love in
its broadest sense: this experience is called _erotas_ (έρωτας) unlike
the more subdued and general form of love, else _agape_ (αγάπη).
Erotas has been symbolised since antiquity as the god Eros, who is
related to Aphrodite, the goddess of both beauty and love in their
broadest sense. In English we have terms such as "erotic" (pertaining
to Eros) and "aphrodisiac" (related to Aphrodite, though here this is a
proxy for erotic and thus not faithful to the archetype of the goddess).

What _Just two days_ describes is the intensely passionate phenomenon
of erotas. The artist is not shy about expressing a desire to defy all
constraints and dismantle all barriers, to be fully present in the
moment of physical attraction, to become one with the lover by not
hedging anything, and consequently to touch the eternal through the
momentary.

Erotas is passion throughout. Authenticity is its beauty. As the
ancient saying goes, it is invincible in battle (_eros anikate mahan_,
«έρως ανίκατε μάχαν»). It being short-lived does not detract from the
experience. If anything, it is what keeps it honest. The encounter has
to be brief, just long enough to ride the wave of excitement but also
to keep lust as the driving force.

Those who share erotas make no pretences to propriety and care not of
meeting social expectations. Such concerns might occur later, once
erotas transpires. But erotas is impervious to the mode of longer-term
planning and will not be burdened by the trivia of everyday affairs.
It shall not be the facade of a business transaction; of securing the
partner that maximises the chances of success in terms of social
mobility and financial outcomes. No! Those may be worthwhile, but they
do not belong to passion of this sort.

When thinking of the different types of love, it is tempting to rank
them and, perhaps, to place erotas at the bottom of the list due to
how ephemeral it tends to be. This song inspires us to refrain from
such an exercise, for it is misguided. It invites us to appreciate
deep-seated erotic desire as such and to recognise it as yet another
facet of the human condition. How can it be lesser (or indeed greater)
when it is equally human?

More generally, _Just two days_ unapologetically presents us with an
aspect of reality. It defies whatever taboo forces people into a
pretentious modus vivendi. Erotas is not interested in conforming with
some ideal of normativity, such as the cultural construct of the coy
lady or the indomitable man qua guardian. There is a place for those,
but not here. The artist then gives us the truth of what the person
wants.

We can choose to echo whatever moral precepts find currency in our
milieu, about suppressing this and sacrificing that, or take the art
as-is. However we go about it, reality does not care about our norms.
Erotas will continue to be there, even if we condemn it as frivolous.
It can still be felt equally by the unabashed womaniser and the shy
girl, no matter the era and prevailing tradition.

Those who wish to understand what it is to be human, do not argue with
the cosmos. They start their inquiry from a position of acceptance and
conclude their investigations in a state of acceptance. They take a
step back to suspend judgement, while they remain calm in the face of
openendedness. Uncertainty will not go away. Every answer engenders a
million questions.

With patience and sincerity, one shall discern the patterns exhibited
in the world and take them for what they are. Only then is it time to
admit, with humility, that without knowledge of the whole, there can
be no final judgement about the parts. Our morality may then be
appraised for what it is: a useful tool to make social life liveable;
a tool that is refined to serve our ever-evolving needs; a tool
nonetheless.
