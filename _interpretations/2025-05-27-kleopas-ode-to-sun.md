excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'Ode to the Sun'."

For this article, I have picked a joyful song by songmaker Kleopas:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM9pCdrLj_k>.

Here are the original lyrics, my faithful translation of them, and
some further philosophical remarks.

Ωδή στον Ήλιο

Ερμηνεία:  Κλεώπας
Στίχοι:    Κλεώπας
Μουσική:   Κλεώπας


Ήλιε μου βασιλεύεις
και μέσα μου χορεύω
Την ομορφιά σου σαν θωρώ
τα χείλη μου σαλεύω

Αχ της ψυχής τα σήμαντρα
λες σε γιορτή ηχούνε
κι όλου του κόσμου οι αγκαλιές
μέσα τους με καλούνε

Ήλιε μου ταξιδιάρη μου
και κοσμογυρισμένε
Ανέβασε με στ'άρμα σου
μαζί σου να πλανιέμαι

Ανέβασε με στ'άρμα σου
μαζί σου να πλανιέμαι
Ήλιε μου ταξιδιάρη μου
Και κοσμογυρισμένε

Ήλιε μου μαγεμένε

Τα μάτια μου μαύρα πουλιά
τις ενοχές στραγγίζουν
Πέρα στις ράχες στα βουνά
χαρά σε μακαρίζουν

Κι αρχίζουν να σου τραγουδούν
τ'αηδόνια της καρδιάς μου
Γιατί ποθήσανε να ιδούν
τα δάκρυα της χαράς μου

Ήλιε μου ταξιδιάρη μου
Και κοσμογυρισμένε
Ανέβασε με στ'άρμα σου
Μαζί σου να πλανιέμαι

Ανέβασε με στ'άρμα σου
Μαζί σου να πλανιέμαι
Ήλιε μου ταξιδιάρη μου
Και κοσμογυρισμένε

Ήλιε μου μαγεμένε
```

Ode to the Sun

Singer:   Kleopas
Lyrics:   Kleopas
Music:    Kleopas


My sun you rise
and I dance inside
Your beauty as I behold
I move my lips

Oh the soul's bells
ring as if at a festival
and all of the world's hugs
call me to them

My travelling sun
and globetrotter
Lift me on your chariot
to be wondering with you

Lift me on your chariot
to be wondering with you
My travelling sun
and globetrotter

My enchanted sun

My eyes black birds
drain away the guilt
Over at the mountain slopes
in joy they praise you

And they begin to sing for you
the nightingales of my heart
Because they desired to see
the tears of my joy

My travelling sun
and globetrotter
Lift me on your chariot
to be wondering with you

Lift me on your chariot
to be wondering with you
My travelling sun
and globetrotter

My enchanted sun
```

The _Ode to the Sun_ is exactly what its title suggests: an
appreciation of an everyday phenomenon that we often take for granted.
This is not about the sun per se, beautiful though it is. It concerns
the little things in life that each of us can experience regardless of
social status, education, or whatever token we use to support the
hierarchies that keep us apart.

When I explore the mountains, I notice how each day produces distinct
phenomena. Today there was plenty of dust in the air. It filtered the
sunlight in a unique way, contributing to the serene landscape. The
cool breeze added to the tranquillity I was feeling. It all reflected
my inner peace. I stood by a cliff, overlooking the valley below, as I
thought to myself how blessed I am to experience such moments and,
indeed, how lucky I am to not be haunted by vainglory anymore.

It is not enough to "go to nature", as one must also be mentally
prepared to enjoy the nuances of this world. While at the great
outdoors, notice how many shades of green there are in any given patch
of grass or across different trees. We do not require a temple
dedicated to some god to experience harmony. Nature needs no
intermediaries: we can just pay attention to the details, like those
plants. From there we develop the habit of recognising the universals
in the particulars. We learn how to connect with the underlying unity
among everything.

The cosmos needs no praise to engender in us a sense of awe. When we
do compose odes such as the one of Kleopas, we do so as a reminder for
us people to stick to the basics. Being present in the moment demands
that we free ourselves from ulterior wants. We simply are content with
bearing witness to an instance in the eternity. It does not boost the
value of our stock holdings, will not earn us a promotion, nor make us
more attractive to a potential spouse.

To be present is to have the quality of character that speaks of
humility, of that which no curriculum vitae can ever express; that
which no business executive shall ever quantify; that which only
sensitive souls can discern. So what if we never become successful in
the conventional sense? It suffices to have the sincerity to sing
along with the birds and the frogs.
