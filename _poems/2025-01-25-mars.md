title: "Poem: Mars"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Some homeland embraced me
To be loved and appreciated
special are those moments
for a simple man to ignore
"Take this rifle and uniform
We shall plant a flag on Mars"
I heed the call of duty
This country loves me now
To fight a war for its sake
so that they may colonise Earth
```
