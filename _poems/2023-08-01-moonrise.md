excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Moonrise of the new beginning
The dog patrols the perimeter
barking at the darkness

Moving shadows along the silver path
Travellers on a journey to nowhere
It is the moments that matter

Heed the voice of the mountain
Play the tune of the wind
and let the soul be anabaptised
```
