excerpt: "Defy the comfort zones while you can."

```
Shadowy figure
The order in this darkness
A blossoming face

The elusive one
Obscure yet mysterious
A shadow in space

This light shall guide me
And I will thus approach you
As you fade away

To worry and fear
That I may forever lose
What I never had
```

Defy the comfort zones while you can.
