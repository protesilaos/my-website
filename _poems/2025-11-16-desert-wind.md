```
At the temple of the goddess
while desert wind
burns through your skin
become the mirror
that reflects light
towards the heavens
where the twin sisters
claim their dominion
And remain steadfast
in the knowledge that
shifting sands
mislead only those
who ignore the stars
```

Note that this is the first poem I have read out in a video. I think
it adds to the experience. Watch it below.
