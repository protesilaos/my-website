title: "Poem: When you are in the wilds"
excerpt: "Just read the poem. No further comment."

This is a slightly modified version of the closing words from the
hour-long video I posted today while looking at the full moon: [Vlog:
hike and philosophy with my four dogs](https://protesilaos.com/news/2025-12-05-vlog-hike-philosophy-four-dogs/).

```
When you are in the wilds
and get to be moonbathed
be inspired to remain silent
Heed the voice
of the great outdoors
Allow yourself the chance
to travel the mindscapes
Let go of concerns
petty worries
and all the trivialities
of everyday life
Think big
to partake in
the cosmic vastness
If you do this consistently
if you do this in earnest
if you hold nothing back
you are effectively
allowing your soul
to be baptised anew
To be anabaptised and thus
to renew its vitality
You will see the world
with a new pair of eyes
and be invigorated
to do what you must
Leave behind
the things that weigh you down
that are holding you back
Focus on what is essential
and what is inessential
you shall forget about
```
