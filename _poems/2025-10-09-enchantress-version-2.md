Below is the revised rendition of [the original](https://protesilaos.com/poems/2022-12-03-enchantress/)
from 2022-12-03. It is in line with the interpretation I wrote this morning: <https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2025-10-09-enchantress-by-protesilaos/>.

```
Enchant me Siren
Guide my ship to your rocks
and drown me in your kiss
```
