title: "Poem: Late bloomer"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."
---

```
In indefinite wait for the elusive
the late bloomer has an unspoken hope
That there will be more Springtime
and that two decades will not matter
Like the highlands' purple-leafed sage
some of us will not be discovered
```
