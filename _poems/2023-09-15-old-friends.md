excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
At dawn we remember them
sitting in the back seat
riding the motorcycle northward
summer days along the coastline
by the harbour bars and the beaches
behind the rocks overlooking the mainland
in the moments we cherish
and the memories we are grateful for
```
