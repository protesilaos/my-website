title: "Poem: Remember me"
excerpt: "Just read the poem. No further comment."

```
While you drown
in ancient waters
lured by a shadow's
promise of comfort
remember me

Whenever bitter frost
shortens your breath
and the hierophant's
teachings ring hollow
remember me

Once nobody recalls
your brave foray
into the hinterlands
depleted though you are
remember me

Remember me
as the untamed force
the glorious dawn
that empowers you
for another tomorrow
```
