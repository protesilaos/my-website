title: "Poem: Juniper leaves"
excerpt: "Just read the poem. No further comment."
---

```
Invisible and unreachable
as the uppermost juniper leaves
against the evening sky
On streets of cobblestone
I greet your likeness
hoping that my initiative
inspires your courage
To transcend the barrier
of induced helplessness
in search for the place
where certain trees
forever hide
in plain sight
```
