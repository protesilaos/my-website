title: "Poem: Magi's domain"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Undisturbed you shall enter the magi's domain
With no expectations, no indecision, no regrets
Your outlook is aligned with your actuality
In self-forgiveness you walk the enchanted lands
And as you look skyward, the eagles salute you
```
