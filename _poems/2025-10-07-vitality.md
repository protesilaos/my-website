title: "Poem: Vitality"
excerpt: "Just read the poem. No further comment."

```
I am the endurance
in your long hikes
the fortitude in all
your commitments
the sheer resilience
in your cold showers
the exuberance in each
of your long days
the star dust permeating
every fibre of your being
the unflinching devotion
to your way of living
the fountain of your
inexhaustible creativity
I am the reason why
you proceed methodically
knowing not to fasten
"forever" on galloping steeds
```
