title: "Poem: Tempests"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Worry not of tempests to be
Moments cannot be embottled
Rain might wash you away
Yet time already does
```

I was inspired to compose this poem while interpreting the song of
Miltos Paschalidis [Tale with sad ending](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2024-11-20-paschalidis-tale-with-sad-ending/).
