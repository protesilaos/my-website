title: "Poem: Man and wolf"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
When man and wolf are one
there is but lightness
Dark are the spaces
where individuality is suppressed
```

I wrote the above poem as the conclusion of [The wolf
within](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2024-08-29-wolf-within/).
