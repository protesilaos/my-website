title: "Poem: Holding hands"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
There is a world, beloved,
where we stand together
holding hands
overlooking the Mediterranean
The scent coming from
orange orchards and cedar forests
reminds us of our shared humanity
It is not diversity that divides us
but the misbegotten notion that
bodies must always fall
```
