excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Olympos fades into blue
The last sun rays give it warmth
I am reminded of the lavenders
beneath the Eucalyptus
at the pine tree of Atlas
As I walk past the giant fennels
I wonder, "are these raindrops?"
"Or tears of joy?"
I cannot tell anymore
```
