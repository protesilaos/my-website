title: "Poem: Vipers"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Vipers bite those who wait for perfection
Your fear and discontent is their prey
Find acceptance in the cold waters
It can only ever be with what is available
The number of acquaintances matters not
but only who walks beside you as an equal
```
