title: "Poem: Perseids"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

I wrote this on the 13th of August but could not publish it earlier
due to lack of electricity at home.

```
The shower of the Perseids
luminates the midnight sky
Do meteors ever dream
of alighting the night of another?
```
