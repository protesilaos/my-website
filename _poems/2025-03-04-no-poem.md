title: "Poem: This is no poem"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."
---

```
This is no poem with laudatory words
It speaks not of your eminence
nor does it seek to impress you
It is but the click of a camera button
that you press when there is no question
of succeeding or failing
It is in the inconsequential
that you recreate yourself
freed from the burden of performance
```
