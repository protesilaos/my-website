title: "Poem: Stella maris"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
Many embarked seaward
pursuing you in the dark

Many fought against waves
hoping to witness the world

Many drowned in murky waters
longing for a better tomorrow

Yet it is here I found you
in the ocean no boat can sail
```
