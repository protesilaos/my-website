```
Tell me about this January sunset
with its cold air and pink clouds
As the red fox approaches
one can only wonder in awe how
in every land, at each corner
there is opportunity and danger
separated only by moments
```

I came up with this poem as I was writing the closing thoughts of [Interpretation of “Those who leave and those who stay” by Yiannis Dionysiou](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2025-01-06-dionysiou-those-who-leave-those-who-stay).
