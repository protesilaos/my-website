title: "Warmth (my poem)"
excerpt: "Just read the poem.  No further comment."

```
A season ends, another begins
The days are shorter now
Crows and magpies reappear
The grapes are left behind
to turn into raisins
A bad vintage by all accounts
Let the birds feast on them
There will be a tomorrow regardless
Befriend the oak trees
They are there for all of us
And heed their wisdom
that tolerance of cold winds
does not constitute warmth within
With or without comforts
only in community you find
what you truly need
```
