Most items in the <code>ef-themes</code> collection are designed to use colors
from many parts of the spectrum.  Those items generally are
inappropriate for users with red-green or blue-yellow color deficiency
(deuteranopia and tritanopia, respectively).  We do, nonetheless,
provide light and dark themes that are optimized for such cases.  The
names of the themes are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ef-deuteranopia-dark</code> and <code>ef-deuteranopia-light</code> for red-green
color deficiency;</li>

<p>
The <code>ef-themes</code> provide a limited set of user options which tweak
secondary aspects of the theme.  No option affects coloration or the
overall character of each theme (<a href="#h:a6dd030c-6b6c-4992-83e8-3438b4607b51">Principles</a>).
</p>

<p>
All customizations need to be evaluated before loading a theme.  Any
change thus requires a theme re-load (<a href="#h:a6dd030c-6b6c-4992-83e8-3438b4607b51">Loading a theme</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b22371a2-9428-4f83-a3ca-884be559cf1d">
<p>
The user option <code>ef-themes-disable-other-themes</code> controls which themes
to disable when loading an Ef theme.
</p>

<p>
When the value is non-nil, the commands <code>ef-themes-toggle</code> and
<code>ef-themes-select</code> will disable all other themes while loading the
specified Ef theme.  This is done to ensure that Emacs does not blend
two or more themes: such blends lead to awkward results that undermine
the work of the designer.
</p>

<p>
When the value is nil, the aforementioned commands will only disable
other themes within the Ef collection.
</p>

<p>
This option is provided because Emacs themes are not necessarily
limited to colors/faces: they can consist of an arbitrary set of
customizations.  Users who use such customization bundles must set
this variable to a nil value.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a58b8e21-0f8f-4763-9b47-185bf7e10043">
<p>
The user option <code>ef-themes-to-toggle</code> expects two symbols that name
items in the Ef themes collection.  The variable <code>ef-themes-collection</code>
includes a list with all relevant symbols.  The user can then switch
between the two specified themes by invoking the <code>ef-themes-toggle</code>
command.
</p>

<p>
If <code>ef-themes-to-toggle</code> does not specify two Ef themes, inform the user
about it while prompting with completion for a theme among our
collection (this is practically the same as the <code>ef-themes-select</code>
command).

<p>
This command is in addition to the other ways of loading a theme, either
with minibuffer completion or at random (<a href="#h:58345e8c-2bec-459c-872c-a85a29e9fe97">Commands to load an Ef theme</a>).

<p>
The user option <code>ef-themes-to-rotate</code> defines a list of Ef themes that

that list and switches to the next item. If the next item is the
current one, it moves to the one after.

By default (a <code>nil</code> value for this user option) no face inherits from
<code>fixed-pitch</code>: they all use the default font family, regardless of
whether it is monospaced or not.
</p>

<p>
When <code>ef-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, faces such
as for Org tables, inline code, code blocks, and the like, are
rendered in a monospaced font at all times.  The user can thus set
their default font family to a proportionately spaced font without
worrying about breaking the alignment of relevant elements, or if they
simply prefer the aesthetics of mixed mono and proportionately spaced
font families.
</p>

<p>
A temporary switch to a proportionately spaced font (known in Emacs as
<code>variable-pitch</code>) can be enabled in the current buffer with the
activation of the built-in <code>variable-pitch-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
To get consistent typography, the user may need to edit the font
family of the <code>fixed-pitch</code> and <code>variable-pitch</code> faces.  The
<code>fontaine</code> package on GNU ELPA (by Protesilaos) can be helpful in this
regard.

<p>
The user option <code>ef-themes-variable-pitch-ui</code> controls whether the
elements of the User Interface (UI) use a proportionately spaced font.
By default (a <code>nil</code> value), all UI elements use the default font
family.  When this user option is set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, all UI
elements will inherit the face <code>variable-pitch</code>, thus rendering them
in a proportionately spaced font.

In this context, the UI elements are:

<p>
The user option <code>ef-themes-headings</code> provides support for individual
heading styles for regular heading levels 0 through 8, as well as the
Org agenda headings.
</p>

<p>
This is an alist that accepts a <code>(KEY . LIST-OF-VALUES)</code> combination.
The <code>KEY</code> is either a number, representing the heading&rsquo;s level (0
through 8) or <code>t</code>, which pertains to the fallback style.  The named
keys <code>agenda-date</code> and <code>agenda-structure</code> apply to the Org agenda.
</p>

<p>
Level 0 is a special heading: it is used for what counts as a document
title or equivalent, such as the <code>#+title</code> construct we find in Org
files.  Levels 1-8 are regular headings.
</p>

<p>
The <code>LIST-OF-VALUES</code> covers symbols that refer to properties, as
described below.  Here is a complete sample with various stylistic
combinations, followed by a presentation of all available properties:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq ef-themes-headings
      '((1 light variable-pitch 1.5)
        (2 regular 1.3)
        (3 1.1)
        (agenda-date 1.3)
        (agenda-structure variable-pitch light 1.8)
        (t variable-pitch)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By default (a <code>nil</code> value for this variable), all headings have a bold
typographic weight, a font family that is the same as the <code>default</code> face
(typically monospaced), and a height that is equal to the <code>default</code>
face&rsquo;s height.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <code>variable-pitch</code> property changes the font family of the heading to
that of the <code>variable-pitch</code> face (normally a proportionately spaced
typeface).  Also check the <code>fontaine</code> package (by Protesilaos) for
tweaking fonts via faces.</li>

<li>The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the heading
accordingly, such as <code>light</code>, <code>semibold</code>, etc.  Valid symbols are
defined in the variable <code>ef-themes-weights</code>.  The absence of a weight
means that bold will be used by virtue of inheriting the <code>bold</code> face.</li>

<li>A number, expressed as a floating point (e.g. 1.5), adjusts the height
of the heading to that many times the base font size.  The default
height is the same as 1.0, though it need not be explicitly stated.
Instead of a floating point, an acceptable value can be in the form of
a cons cell like <code>(height . FLOAT)</code> or <code>(height FLOAT)</code>, where <code>FLOAT</code>
is the given number.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list, like in
these examples:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(semibold)
(variable-pitch semibold)
(variable-pitch semibold 1.3)
(variable-pitch semibold (height 1.3))   ; same as above
(variable-pitch semibold (height . 1.3)) ; same as above
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The order in which the properties are set is not significant.
</p>

<p>
In user configuration files the form may look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq ef-themes-headings
      '((1 light variable-pitch 1.5)
        (2 regular 1.3)
        (3 1.1)
        (t variable-pitch)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When defining the styles per heading level, it is possible to pass a
non-<code>nil</code> non-list value (e.g. <code>t</code>) instead of a list of properties.
This will retain the original aesthetic for that level.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq ef-themes-headings
      '((1 . t)           ; keep the default style
        (2 variable-pitch 1.2)
        (t variable-pitch))) ; style for all unspecified headings

(setq ef-themes-headings
      '((1 variable-pitch 1.6)
        (2 1.3)
        (t . t))) ; default style for all unspecified levels

Each Ef theme specifies a color palette that declares named color
values and semantic color mappings:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Named colors consist of a symbol and a string that specifies a
hexadecimal RGB value.  For example: <code>(blue-warmer "#5250ef")</code>.</li>

<li>The semantic color mappings associate an abstract construct with a
given named color from the palette, like <code>(prose-done green-cooler)</code>.
Both elements of the list are symbols, though the <code>cadr</code> (value) can
be a string that specifies a color, such as <code>(prose-done "#5250ef")</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of those subsets can be overridden, thus refashioning the theme.
Overrides are either shared, by being stored in the user option
<code>ef-themes-common-palette-overrides</code>, or they are specific to the
theme they name.  In the latter case, the naming scheme of each
palette variable is <code>THEME-NAME-palette-overrides</code>, thus yielding:

<p>
Theme-specific overrides take precedence over the shared ones.  It is
strongly advised that shared overrides do NOT alter color values, as
those will not be appropriate for both dark and light themes.  Common
overrides are best limited to the semantic color mappings as those use
the color value that corresponds to the active theme (e.g. make the
cursor <code>blue-warmer</code> in all themes, whatever the value of
<code>blue-warmer</code> is in each theme).
</p>

<p>
The value of any overrides&rsquo; variable must mirror a theme&rsquo;s palette.
Palette variables are named after their theme as <code>THEME-NAME-palette</code>.
For example, the <code>ef-summer-palette</code> is like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defconst ef-summer-palette
  '(
;;; Basic values

    (bg-main     "#fff2f3")
    (fg-main     "#4f4073")
    (bg-dim      "#f2e4ea")
    (fg-dim      "#786e74")
    (bg-alt      "#efd3e4")
    (fg-alt      "#af4988")

    (bg-active   "#cfb3c4")
    (bg-inactive "#f7ebee")

;;; Basic hues for foreground values

    (red             "#d3303a")
    (red-warmer      "#e00033")
    (red-cooler      "#d50f7f")
    (red-faint       "#c24552")

    ;; ...

    (blue            "#375ce6")
    (blue-warmer     "#5250ef")
    (blue-cooler     "#065fff")
    (blue-faint      "#6060d0")

    ;; ...

;;; Mappings

    ;; ...

;;;; Code mappings

    (builtin magenta)
    (comment yellow-faint)
    (constant red-cooler)
    (fnname magenta-warmer)
    (keyword magenta-cooler)
    (preprocessor green-warmer)
    (docstring cyan-faint)
    (string yellow-warmer)
    (type cyan-warmer)
    (variable blue-warmer)

    ;; ...
    ))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>ef-summer-palette-overrides</code> targets the entries that need to be
changed.  For example, to make the cursor orange, use a shade of red
for comments, and apply a cyan hue to keywords:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq ef-summer-palette-overrides
      '((cursor "#ef9050")
        (comment red-faint)
        (keyword cyan-cooler)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Changes take effect upon theme reload.  Overrides are removed by
setting their variable to a <code>nil</code> value.
</p>

<p>
The common accented foregrounds in each palette follow a predictable
naming scheme: <code>HUE{,-warmer,-cooler,-faint,-intense}</code>.  <code>HUE</code> is one
of the six basic colors: red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan.
</p>

<p>
Named colors that are meant to be used as backgrounds contain <code>bg</code> in
their name, such as <code>bg-red-intense</code>.  While special purpose
foregrounds that are meant to be combined with such backgrounds,
contain <code>fg</code> in their name, such as <code>fg-removed</code> which complements
<code>bg-removed</code>.
</p>

<p>
Named colors can be previewed with the <code>ef-themes-preview-colors</code>
command.  Changes to color values are reflected in the preview of the
theme&rsquo;s palette (<a href="#h:8dd67bf5-879e-46e5-b277-5bac141f53d1">Preview theme colors</a>).  They are shown at the top of
the buffer.  In the above example, the first instance of <code>blue-warmer</code>
is the override and the second is the original one.

<p>
Emacs can load and maintain enabled multiple themes at once.  This
typically leads to awkward styling and weird combinations.  The theme
looks broken and the designer&rsquo;s intent is misunderstood.  Before
loading one of the <code>ef-themes</code>, the user is encouraged to disable all
others (<a href="#h:b22371a2-9428-4f83-a3ca-884be559cf1d">Disable other themes</a>):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then load the theme of choice.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(load-theme 'ef-summer :no-confirm)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>:no-confirm</code> is optional.  It simply skips the step where Emacs
asks the user whether they are sure about loading the theme.
</p>

<p>
Consider adding code like the above to the user configuration file, such
as <code>init.el</code>.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If you plan on using the <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code>, the above
method will not work.  Instead, you need to load the theme from your
init file with <code>ef-themes-select</code> (<a href="#h:58345e8c-2bec-459c-872c-a85a29e9fe97">Commands to load an Ef theme</a>).  For
example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

(ef-themes-select 'ef-summer)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:58345e8c-2bec-459c-872c-a85a29e9fe97">
<p>
The commands mentioned herein call <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code> at the
end.  This is for advanced users who want to trigger some code after an
Ef theme is loaded (<a href="#h:5b74bd9e-e7f2-46b3-af2e-7c45b2e69245">Use colors from the active Ef theme</a>).  The same goes
for <code>ef-themes-toggle</code> and <code>ef-themes-rotate</code>.

</ul>

<p>
The themes can also be loaded interactively.  The command
<code>ef-themes-select</code> (call it with <code>M-x</code>) prompts with minibuffer
completion for a theme among the collection of items we provide.  It
then loads the selected theme.  Internally, <code>ef-themes-select</code> takes
care to disable any other Ef theme, though it does not disable other
themes.  This is by design to let users maintain theme blending when
they want it.  Otherwise, the user is encouraged to disable all other
themes and stick with the Ef themes:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>ef-themes-select</code> command can also be called from the user&rsquo;s init
file to load the theme of their choice (<a href="#h:75d74aea-d17f-497f-a3b8-f0bf4c372de0">Loading a theme</a>).  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; like `load-theme' but also call `ef-themes-post-load-hook'
(ef-themes-select 'ef-summer)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When <code>ef-themes-select</code> is called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by
default), it first produces a minibuffer prompt to limit the choice to
dark or light themes, and then shows only the relevant subset.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling <code>ef-themese-select</code> with a prefix argument, users
can invoke either of <code>ef-themes-select-dark</code>, <code>ef-themes-select-light</code>
commands.  Those behave the same as <code>ef-themes-select</code> except they
limit the interaction to dark or light Ef themes, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>ef-themes-load-random</code> is for those who appreciate a bit of
serendipity in their life.  When call interactively with <code>M-x</code> it loads
a random theme from the Ef themes collection.  The selection excludes
the current Ef theme.  Calling <code>ef-themes-load-random</code> with a prefix
argument (<code>C-u</code> by default) makes the command limit the random selection
to either light or dark themes.  The user is prompted at the minibuffer
to pick among the two sets.
</p>

<p>
The <code>ef-themes-load-random</code> can also be called from Lisp (e.g. from the
<code>init.el</code> file):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(ef-themes-load-random)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This has the effect of loading an Ef theme at random, as described
above.  It is also possible to limit the set with either of those:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Load a light Ef theme at random
(ef-themes-load-random 'light)

;; Load a dark Ef theme at random
(ef-themes-load-random 'dark)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The author of the Ef themes likes to check with their operating system
to determine if the desktop environment outside of Emacs is using a
light/dark theme and then loads an appropriate Ef theme at random:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Check GNOME's gsettings database for the dark theme preference.  If
;; it is enabled, we want to load a dark Ef theme at random.  Otherwise
;; we load a random light theme.
(if (string-match-p
     "dark"
     (shell-command-to-string "gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme"))
    (ef-themes-load-random 'dark)
  (ef-themes-load-random 'light))

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:8dd67bf5-879e-46e5-b277-5bac141f53d1">
<p>
The command <code>ef-themes-preview-colors</code> uses minibuffer completion to
select an item from the Ef themes and then produces a buffer with
previews of its color palette entries.  The buffer has a naming scheme
which reflects the given choice, like <code>ef-summer-preview-colors</code> for the
<code>ef-summer</code> theme.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>ef-themes-preview-colors-current</code> skips the minibuffer
selection process and just produces a preview for the current Ef theme.
</p>

<p>
When called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> with the default key
bindings), these commands will show a preview of the palette&rsquo;s
semantic color mappings instead of the named colors.
</p>

<p>
Aliases for those commands are <code>ef-themes-list-colors</code> and
<code>ef-themes-list-colors-current</code>.
</p>

<p>
Overrides to color values are reflected in the buffers produced by the
aforementioned commands (<a href="#h:4b923795-4b23-4345-81e5-d1c108a84b6a">Palette overrides</a>).
</p>

<p>
Each row shows a foreground and background coloration using the
underlying value it references.  For example a line with <code>#d3303a</code> (a
shade of red) will show red text followed by a stripe with that same
color as a backdrop.
</p>

<p>
The name of the buffer describes the given Ef theme and what the
contents are, such as <code>*ef-summer-list-colors*</code> for named colors and
<code>*ef-summer-list-mappings*</code> for the semantic color mappings.

<p>
Advanced users may want to call color variables from the palette of the
active Ef theme.  The macro <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> supplies those to
any form called inside of it.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(ef-themes-with-colors
  (list bg-main fg-main bg-mode-line cursor))
;; =&gt; ("#fff2f3" "#5f456f" "#ffa4dc" "#cf0090")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The above return value is for <code>ef-summer</code> when that is the active Ef
theme.  Switching to another theme and evaluating this code anew will
give us the relevant results for that theme.  The same with <code>ef-winter</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(ef-themes-with-colors

The fuction <code>ef-themes-get-color-value</code> can be called from Lisp to
return the value of a color from the active Ef theme palette.  It
takea a <code>COLOR</code> argument and an optional <code>OVERRIDES</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>COLOR</code> is a symbol that represents a named color entry in the
palette.

<a href="#h:8dd67bf5-879e-46e5-b277-5bac141f53d1">Preview theme colors</a>.

<p>
If the value is the name of another color entry in the palette (so a
mapping), this function recurs until it finds the underlying color
value.
</p>

<p>
With an optional <code>OVERRIDES</code> argument as a non-nil value, it accounts
for palette overrides.  Else it reads only the default palette.
</p>

<p>
With optional <code>THEME</code> as a symbol among <code>ef-themes-collection</code>, use
the palette of that item.  Else use the current Ef theme.

If <code>COLOR</code> is not present in the palette, this function returns the
<code>unspecified</code> symbol, which is safe when used as a face attribute&rsquo;s
value.

When the user wants to customize Emacs faces there are two
considerations they need to make if they care about robustness:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do not hardcode color values, but instead use the relevant variables
from the Ef themes.</li>
<li>Make the changes persist through theme changes between the Ef themes
collection.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For point 1 we provide the <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> macro, while for
point 2 we have the <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#h:5b74bd9e-e7f2-46b3-af2e-7c45b2e69245">Use colors from the active Ef theme</a>.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a href="#h:1dbea3c9-de9a-4bb4-b540-654bea70ba4d">A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading</a>.
</p>

<p>
We need to wrap our code in the <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> and declare it
as a function which we then add to the hook.  Here we show the general
approach of putting those pieces together.
</p>

<p>
To customize faces in a way that mirrors the Ef themes&rsquo; source code,
we use the built-in <code>custom-set-faces</code>.  The value it accepts has the
same syntax as that found in <code>ef-themes.el</code>, specifically the
<code>ef-themes-faces</code> constant.  It thus is easy to copy lines from there
and tweak them.  Let&rsquo;s pick a couple of font-lock faces (used in all
programming modes, among others):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-ef-themes-custom-faces ()
  "My customizations on top of the Ef themes.
This function is added to the `ef-themes-post-load-hook'."
  (ef-themes-with-colors
    (custom-set-faces
     ;; These are the default specifications
     `(font-lock-comment-face ((,c :inherit italic :foreground ,comment)))
     `(font-lock-variable-name-face ((,c :foreground ,variable))))))

;; Using the hook lets our changes persist when we use the commands
;; `ef-themes-toggle', `ef-themes-select', and `ef-themes-load-random'.
(add-hook 'ef-themes-post-load-hook #'my-ef-themes-custom-faces)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each item in the Ef themes collection has its own color mapping.  So
the color value of the <code>comment</code> variable will differ from theme to
theme.  For the purpose of our demonstration, we make variables look
like comments and comments like variables:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-ef-themes-custom-faces ()
  "My customizations on top of the Ef themes.
This function is added to the `ef-themes-post-load-hook'."
  (ef-themes-with-colors
    (custom-set-faces
     `(font-lock-comment-face ((,c :foreground ,variable)))
     `(font-lock-variable-name-face ((,c :inherit italic :foreground ,comment))))))

;; Using the hook lets our changes persist when we use the commands
;; `ef-themes-toggle', `ef-themes-select', and `ef-themes-load-random'.
(add-hook 'ef-themes-post-load-hook #'my-ef-themes-custom-faces)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
All changes take effect when a theme is loaded again.  As such, it is
better to use <code>ef-themes-select</code> at startup so that the function added
to the hook gets applied properly upon first load.  Like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-ef-themes-custom-faces ()
  "My customizations on top of the Ef themes.
This function is added to the `ef-themes-post-load-hook'."
  (ef-themes-with-colors
    (custom-set-faces
     `(font-lock-comment-face ((,c :foreground ,variable)))
     `(font-lock-variable-name-face ((,c :inherit italic :foreground ,comment))))))

;; Using the hook lets our changes persist when we use the commands
;; `ef-themes-toggle', `ef-themes-select', and `ef-themes-load-random'.
(add-hook 'ef-themes-post-load-hook #'my-ef-themes-custom-faces)

;; Load the theme and run `ef-themes-post-load-hook'
(ef-themes-select 'ef-summer) ; Instead of (load-theme 'ef-summer :no-confirm)
</pre>

<h3 id="h:1dbea3c9-de9a-4bb4-b540-654bea70ba4d"><span class="section-number-3">10.3.</span> A theme-agnostic hook for theme loading</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:1dbea3c9-de9a-4bb4-b540-654bea70ba4d">
<p>
The themes are designed with the intent to be useful to Emacs users of
varying skill levels, from beginners to experts.  This means that we try
to make things easier by not expecting anyone reading this document to
be proficient in Emacs Lisp or programming in general.
</p>

<p>
Such a case is with the use of the <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code>, which is
called after the evaluation of any of the commands we provide for
loading a theme (<a href="#h:58345e8c-2bec-459c-872c-a85a29e9fe97">Commands to load an Ef theme</a>).  We recommend using that
hook for advanced customizations, because (1) we know for sure that it
is available once the themes are loaded, and (2) anyone consulting this
manual, especially the sections on enabling and loading the themes, will
be in a good position to benefit from that hook.
</p>

<p>
Advanced users who have a need to switch between the Ef themes and other
items (e.g. my <code>modus-themes</code>) will find that such a hook does not meet
their requirements: it only works with the Ef themes and only with the
aforementioned functions.
</p>

<p>
A theme-agnostic setup can be configured thus:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defvar after-enable-theme-hook nil
   "Normal hook run after enabling a theme.")

(defun run-after-enable-theme-hook (&amp;rest _args)
   "Run `after-enable-theme-hook'."
   (run-hooks 'after-enable-theme-hook))

(advice-add 'enable-theme :after #'run-after-enable-theme-hook)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This creates the <code>after-enable-theme-hook</code> and makes it run after each
call to <code>enable-theme</code>, which means that it will work for all themes and
also has the benefit that it does not depend on functions such as
<code>ef-themes-select</code> and the others mentioned in this manual.  The
function <code>enable-theme</code> is called internally by <code>load-theme</code>, so the
hook works everywhere.
</p>

<p>
The downside of the theme-agnostic hook is that any functions added to
it will likely not be able to benefit from macro calls that read the
active theme, such as <code>ef-themes-with-colors</code> (the Modus themes have
an equivalent macro).  Not all Emacs themes have the same
capabilities.
</p>

<p>
In this document, we always mention <code>ef-themes-post-load-hook</code> though
the user can replace it with <code>after-enable-theme-hook</code> should they need
to (provided they understand the implications).
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a5140c9c-18b2-45db-8021-38d0b5074116">
<p>
By the default, the background of the <code>region</code> face extends from the
end of the line to the edge of the window.  To limit it to the end of
the line, we need to override the face&rsquo;s <code>:extend</code> attribute.  Adding
this to the Emacs configuration file will suffice:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

rests on the user to specify appropriate color values.  This can be done
either by hardcoding colors, which is inefficient, or by using the macro

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:8c0b05b7-5624-4051-844c-3c4882658782">
<p>
The Ef themes do not hardcode a <code>:weight</code> or <code>:slant</code> attribute in the
faces they cover.  Instead, they configure the generic faces called
<code>bold</code> and <code>italic</code> to use the appropriate styles and then instruct all
relevant faces that require emphasis to inherit from them.
</p>

<p>
This practically means that users can change the particularities of what
it means for a construct to be bold/italic, by tweaking the <code>bold</code> and
<code>italic</code> faces.  Cases where that can be useful include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The default typeface does not have a variant with slanted glyphs
(e.g. Fira Mono/Code as of this writing on 2022-08-23), so the user
wants to add another family for the italics, such as Hack.</li>

<li>The typeface of choice provides a multitude of weights and the user
prefers the light one by default.  To prevent the bold weight from
being too heavy compared to the light one, they opt to make <code>bold</code> use a
semibold weight.</li>

<li>The typeface distinguishes between oblique and italic forms by
providing different font variants (the former are just slanted
versions of the upright forms, while the latter have distinguishing
features as well).  In this case, the user wants to specify the font
that applies to the <code>italic</code> face.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To achieve those effects, one must first be sure that the fonts they use
have support for those features.
</p>

<p>
In this example, we set the default font family to Fira Code, while we
choose to render italics in the Hack typeface (obviously one needs to
pick fonts that work in tandem):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Fira Code" :height 110)
(set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family "Hack")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And here we play with different weights, using Source Code Pro:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Source Code Pro" :height 110 :weight 'light)
(set-face-attribute 'bold nil :weight 'semibold)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To reset the font family, one can use this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(set-face-attribute 'italic nil :family 'unspecified)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Consider the <code>fontaine</code> package on GNU ELPA (by Protesilaos) which
provides the means to configure font families via faces.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:32e3b7b2-3b53-4ec2-bd4e-fa24235e447d">
<p>
The <code>org-modern</code> package uses faces and text properties to make Org
buffers more aesthetically pleasing.  It affects tables, timestamps,
lists, headings, and more.
</p>

<p>
In previous versions of the Ef themes, we mistakenly affected one of its
faces: the <code>org-modern-label</code>.  It changed the intended looks and
prevented the user option <code>org-modern-label-border</code> from having its
desired effect.  As such, we no longer override that face.
</p>

<p>
Users who were used to the previous design and who generally do not
configure the user options of <code>org-modern</code> may thus notice a change in
how clocktables (or generally tables with timestamps) are aligned.  The
simplest solution is to instruct the mode to not prettify timestamps, by
setting the user option <code>org-modern-timestamp</code> to <code>nil</code>.  For example, by
adding this to the init file:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq org-modern-timestamp nil)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Alignment in tables will also depend on the use of proportionately
spaced fonts.  Enable the relevant option to work with those without any
further trouble (<a href="#h:621d3bb9-5967-4f97-b253-7470bba9168c">Enable mixed fonts</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d42f726c-44e5-4dd6-b77e-e6ca0bab3189">
<p>
The built-in <code>goto-address-mode</code> uses heuristics to identify URLs and
email addresses in the current buffer.  It then applies a face to them
to change their style.  Some packages, such as <code>notmuch</code>, use this
minor-mode automatically.
</p>

<p>
The faces are not declared with <code>defface</code>, meaning that it is better
that the theme does not modify them.  The user is thus encouraged to
consider including this in their setup:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq goto-address-url-face 'link
      goto-address-url-mouse-face 'highlight
      goto-address-mail-face 'link
      goto-address-mail-mouse-face 'highlight)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
My personal preference is to set <code>goto-address-mail-face</code> to <code>nil</code>,
because it otherwise adds too much visual noise to the buffer (email
addresses stand out more, due to the use of the uncommon <code>@</code> caharacter
but also because they are often enclosed in angled brackets).

The themes define some faces to make it possible to achieve
consistency between various groups of faces.  For example, all &ldquo;marks

user wants to edit this face to include an underline, the change will
apply to lots of packages, like Dired, Trashed, Ibuffer.

state.  Styling a package requires a lot of work as one must (i) know
how the package works, (ii) see all its interfaces in action, (iii)
make sure that the color combinations look consistent with the rest of
the theme.</li>

<li>Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the main background (WCAG AA
standard).  Emphasis on &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; as themes can always have more
contrast.  Use my <code>modus-themes</code> package (also built into Emacs 28

considerations for legibility, and (ii) are not designed on a whimsy.

(ii) want something with a bit more flair, and (iii) are fine with a
bit more relaxed accessibility target.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:9efafe65-1a2c-4f50-88bf-885f60afe27e">
<p>
The main difference between the two projects is that the
<code>modus-themes</code> are much more strict with maintaining the highest
standard for contrast (I won&rsquo;t delve into the technicalities, though
the manual of the <code>modus-themes</code> does elaborate on the minutiae).
Whereas the <code>ef-themes</code> do not have such a commitment: they are
legible, but might go a bit below the desired target in certain cases.
</p>

<p>
For the user who has already narrowed their search to the Modus and Ef
themes, the criterion should be the eye test.  If any of those items
looks good/usable, then that is what matters.  A bit of
experimentation provides greater insight than tomes on theoretical
nuances&#x2014;no value in overthinking it.
</p>

<p>
Between the <code>ef-themes</code> and the <code>modus-themes</code>, I provide a broad
range of options for users who need varying degrees of legibility.
The <code>modus-themes</code> are the ones with the highest contrast.
</p>

<p>
I have always maintained the view that (i) there is no such thing as a
one-size-fits-all for accessibility due to innate differences in color
perception between individuals as well as hardware capabilities, and
(ii) no theme can handle accessibility on its own, as one needs to
consider typography as well as environmental factors.
</p>

<p>
[ For my preferred typography, check Iosevka Comfy:
  <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/iosevka-comfy-pictures">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/iosevka-comfy-pictures</a>. ]
</p>

<p>
Technically, the very high contrast of the <code>modus-themes</code> demands that
they are not&#x2014;and can never be&#x2014;as colorful as the <code>ef-themes</code>.
Their colors are less saturated.  In terms of presentation, this means
that the <code>modus-themes</code> may appear more minimalist (or &ldquo;clean&rdquo;) once
one gets used to their level of contrast.  In general: do not trust
initial impressions and give the themes a fair chance (if one is used
to low contrast settings, the <code>modus-themes</code> feel hard to get used to,
though this is natural as the eye adapts accordingly).
</p>

<p>
The <code>ef-themes</code> are more colorful, which can make them more/less
pleasant to work with, depending on one&rsquo;s subjectivity.  Within the
<code>ef-themes</code>, there is considerable diversity, as each of the 20 items
has its own character, expressed as a unique color palette and color
mapping.  No two themes are alike.  For example, for light themes
<code>ef-summer</code> gives the user a completely different vibe than
<code>ef-frost</code>, while for dark themes <code>ef-bio</code> and <code>ef-cherie</code> each have
their unique charm.
</p>

<p>
I cannot possibly say which the &ldquo;best&rdquo; is.  This is a subjective
evaluation.  For me personally, both projects are technically
excellent in terms of conforming with their stated ends.
Aesthetically, I like them all, which is why I develop/maintain them.
I am not prioritising one over the others.
</p>

<p>
Note that I am emphasising legibility, though this should not discount
the meticulous work that goes into thematic consistency.  I do not
write about this topic because it does not really matter to the
average user.  Consistency is not something that should actively be
calling for one&rsquo;s attention, though it is &ldquo;there&rdquo; for those who wish
to pay attention.  In short: I am not picking random colors and
implementing them on a whimsy.  Theme development is not easy.

<p>
Take a deep breath, drink some water, get some fresh air, and take it
one step at a time.  You don&rsquo;t have to try all the themes outright.
For a light theme, go with <code>ef-light</code>; for a dark one use <code>ef-dark</code>.
They have generic names exactly for this reason.  Then make the
necessary tweaks to toggle between those two and don&rsquo;t worry anymore
about the abundance of choice (<a href="#h:a58b8e21-0f8f-4763-9b47-185bf7e10043">Toggle between two Ef themes</a>).  Good

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b59f315c-6d25-4225-b99b-c06594fa3bf0">
<p>
Upstream Org defines tags in headings to have the same color as the rest
of the heading&rsquo;s text.  However, tags are a distinct component of the
heading as noted in the doc string of the <code>org-get-heading</code> function.
Tags also are functionally different than the ordinary text of the
heading: they are a clickable link/button.  It thus is a matter of
usability to render this distinction clear at the visual level: I do not
agree with upstream Org&rsquo;s design decision.
</p>

<p>
Normally, we would style a link to have an underline.  However, this
design does not look right in headings (as it doesn&rsquo;t look right in,
e.g., the headings in a listing of emails or the unread items in the
Elfeed list of entries).  We thus have to go with the next option, which
is to use a distinct foreground color that differentiates the tag from
its context, while accounting for theme-wide usability and consistency.
</p>

<p>
The overarching principle is that when two things function differently,
they have to look apart even if the difference is small.
</p>

<p>
The assumption that tags are right-aligned (per Org&rsquo;s default behaviour)
does not hold, as there exists a user option to disable this effect:
<code>org-auto-align-tags</code>.  The author of the <code>ef-themes</code> uses this option
because the way Org performs this alignment using literal spaces does
not work properly with (i) proportionately spaced fonts, (ii) varying
heading heights, (iii) different levels of indentation.  Realigning tags
by inserting spaces also creates noise in version-controlled files,
which is undesirable.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:103def23-def7-48f9-b14b-4089e4e13242">
<p>
In general, I am not against the idea of drawing inspiration from other
themes.  Note though that every item in the <code>ef-themes</code> collection is
designed from scratch to work in accordance with the principles of this
project (<a href="#h:a6dd030c-6b6c-4992-83e8-3438b4607b51">Principles</a>).
</p>

<p>
Each palette is an original implementation.  The six basic hues of red,
green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan are implemented as quartets of a
base, warmer, cooler, and faint variants.
</p>

<p>
All themes have their own color mapping, which is conducted in
accordance with the exact values of the aforementioned hues and their
innate relations.
</p>

<p>
Copying another project&rsquo;s palette is generally not possible or not
desirable, not even if that is my <code>modus-themes</code> (they, too, have a
different set of requirements).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, trying to mimic another theme generally is an exercise with
prior constraints, as we are always labouring under the expectation of
remaining faithful to the original.  This can lead to awkward
compromises and sub-optimal choices, which make no sense for a project
with opinionanted design principles.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
