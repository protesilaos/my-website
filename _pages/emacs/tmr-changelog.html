This version adds quality-of-life improvements to an already stable
base.

<p>
The <code>tmr-with-description</code> would always prompt for a time input and
then a description of the resulting timer object. We now provide a
more general command, <code>tmr-with-details</code>, which does this in addition
to an extra prompt for an acknowledgement. What an "acknowledgement"
is, is documented in the following section.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:1a971ba1-09a6-4df6-bbe5-73685430417c">
<p>
Normally, when a timer elapses it does not stick around to notify the
user again and again. This means that the user may miss the one
notification if, say, they were away from the computer. As such, we
now provide an opt-in mechanism where a timer persists until it is
explicitly acknowledged as finished. The acknowledgement is either an
additional duration for the timer to produce another notification in
the future, or an explicit consent from the timer to count as
finished. The goal is to help the user never miss a timer.
</p>

<p>
Setting up an acknowledgement can be done in the following ways:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Call the standard <code>tmr</code> command with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by
default). This will make it prompt for a description and an
acknowledgement.</li>

<li>Use the new command <code>tmr-with-details</code>, which asks for a timer
input, a description, and whether to include an acknowledgement
prompt.</li>

<li>Use the new command <code>tmr-toggle-acknowledge</code>, which will prompt for
a timer and then toggle the acknowledgement status on/off. In this
scenario, the timer already exists (e.g. it was created with <code>tmr</code>
without a prefix argument).</li>
</ul>

<p>
All timers are listed in a nice list with the command
<code>tmr-tabulated-view</code>. An extra column will indicate their
acknowledgement status.

<p>
The general theme of this release is that TMR became simpler, better,
and more robust.  Daniel Mendler provided lots of patches and is now
recognised as co-author of the package together with Damien Cassou and
me (Protesilaos).  With the exception of documentation changes and other
accompanying tweaks, all of the following are courtesy of Daniel
Mendler.  Consult the git log for the minutia.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Timers can also be set using an absolute time input.  For example,
<code>21:45</code> will set a timer from now until the specified time.  The
familiar ways of starting timers with relative values, work as they
did before.  This is part of a wider internal revision to make the
parsing of input more strict.</li>

<li><p>
TMR no longer maintains distinct feature sets between its minibuffer
and tabulated interfaces.  What works in one context, works equally in
the other.  All commands that were formerly available only in the
<code>tmr-tabulated-mode</code> (accessed via <code>tmr-tabulated-view</code>) are now
implemented anew to provide the requisite minibuffer capabilities.
When called from inside the <code>tmr-tabulated-mode</code>, the commands operate
on the timer at point.  Otherwise they prompt for completion among the
available timers (where relevant).  This covers all operations for
creating, cloning, [re-]describing, rescheduling, and removing timers.
The <code>tmr-tabulated-mode-map</code> is updated thus:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (defvar tmr-tabulated-mode-map
    (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
      (define-key map "k" #'tmr-remove)
      (define-key map "r" #'tmr-remove)
      (define-key map "R" #'tmr-remove-finished)
      (define-key map "+" #'tmr)
      (define-key map "t" #'tmr)
      (define-key map "*" #'tmr-with-description)
      (define-key map "T" #'tmr-with-description)
      (define-key map "c" #'tmr-clone)
      (define-key map "e" #'tmr-edit-description)
      (define-key map "s" #'tmr-reschedule)
      map)
    "Keybindings for `tmr-tabulated-mode-map'.")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, our sample key bindings are these:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  ;; OPTIONALLY set your own global key bindings:
  (let ((map global-map))
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t t") #'tmr)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t T") #'tmr-with-description)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t l") #'tmr-tabulated-view) ; "list timers" mnemonic
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t c") #'tmr-clone)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t k") #'tmr-cancel)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t s") #'tmr-reschedule)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t e") #'tmr-edit-description)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t r") #'tmr-remove)
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c t R") #'tmr-remove-finished))
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
The tabulated view now shows the remaining time for all timer objects.
This is how the <code>*tmr-tabulated-view*</code> buffer is formatted:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga2d661d">
  Start      End        Remaining  Description
  10:11:49   10:11:54   ✔
  10:11:36   10:31:36   19m 35s
  10:11:32   10:26:32   14m 31s    Yet another test
  10:11:16   10:21:16   9m 14s     Testing how it works
</pre></li>

<li><p>
All timer objects are refactored to expose a properly formatted
completion table.  The completion category is <code>tmr-timer</code>.  In
practical terms, <code>embark</code> (and other standards-compliant packages) can
operate on them.  The manual provides sample glue code for Embark:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (defvar tmr-action-map
    (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
      (define-key map "k" #'tmr-remove)
      (define-key map "r" #'tmr-remove)
      (define-key map "R" #'tmr-remove-finished)
      (define-key map "c" #'tmr-clone)
      (define-key map "e" #'tmr-edit-description)
      (define-key map "s" #'tmr-reschedule)
      map))

  (with-eval-after-load 'embark
    (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(tmr-timer . tmr-action-map))
    (cl-loop
     for cmd the key-bindings of tmr-action-map
     if (commandp cmd) do
     (add-to-list 'embark-post-action-hooks (list cmd 'embark--restart))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/embark/wiki/Additional-Actions#actions-for-prots-tmr-tmr-may-ring">Embark Wiki</a> is updated accordingly.
</p></li>

<li>The new user option <code>tmr-confirm-single-timer</code> governs how TMR should
behave while operating on the sole timer.  If non-nil (the default),
TMR will always use the minibuffer to select a timer object to operate
on, even when there is only one candidate available.  If set to nil,
TMR will not ask for confirmation when there is one timer available:
the operation will be carried out outright.  The default value is
optimal for use with Embark.</li>

<li><p>
The existing user option <code>tmr-description-list</code> is revised to accept
either a list of strings (the old approach) or a symbol of a variable
that holds a list of strings.  In the latter case, this can be the
<code>tmr-description-history</code>, which is a variable that stores the user's
input at the relevant minibuffer prompt.  We have made this the new
default value, as it grows naturally to reflect one's usage of TMR.
Minibuffer histories can persist between sessions if the user enables
the built-in <code>savehist</code> library.  Sample configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (require 'savehist)
  (setq savehist-file (locate-user-emacs-file "savehist"))
  (setq history-length 10000)
  (setq history-delete-duplicates t)
  (setq savehist-save-minibuffer-history t)
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'savehist-mode)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>Fixed an edge case where a <code>when-let*</code> form did not return the
expected value.  Thanks to Nathan R. DeGruchy for the patch.  The
patch is below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require
copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:

<p>
The gist of TMR's May Release is that TMR is Maintained Rigorously&#x2014;but
enough with The Mostly Recursive acronyms!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is the first version for which we produce a change log.  The
short story of previous releases: I (Protesilaos) was using and
developing TMR (pronounced as "timer" or "T-M-R") as part of my
personal setup for more than a year until I eventually contributed it
to GNU ELPA.</li>

<li>What was once <code>tmr.el</code> is now split up into purpose-specific files:
<code>tmr.el</code> (core functionality), <code>tmr-tabulated.el</code> (grid view),
<code>tmr-sound.el</code> (audible notifications), and <code>tmr-notification.el</code>
(desktop notifications).</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-with-description</code> command creates a new timer while always
asking for a description.  Whereas the standard <code>tmr</code> command prompts
for a description only when invoked with a prefix argument.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-clone</code> command copies the duration and optional description
of an existing timer object into a new one.  The operation is
performed without further questions, except if a prefix argument is
supplied: in that case the command will prompt for a duration and, if
the original timer had a description, for one as well.  The default
values of these prompts are those of the original timer.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-remove-finished</code> deletes all elapsed timers.  This means that
they are removed from the list of available timers and, thus, cannot
be cloned.</li>

<li>The <code>tmr-timer-created-functions</code>, <code>tmr-timer-completed-functions</code>,
and <code>tmr-timer-cancelled-functions</code> are hooks which can be used to
control what happens once a timer is (i) created, (ii) elapses, or
(iii) is cancelled.</li>

<li><p>
Elapsed and running timers are displayed in a grid view with the
command <code>tmr-tabulated-view</code>.  The buffer looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbac867d">
  Start      End        Finished?  Description
  09:22:43   09:32:43   ✔         Prepare tea
  09:17:14   09:37:14              Boil water
  09:07:03   09:57:03              Bake bread
</pre></li>

<li>In that grid view, it is possible to create a new timer, or operate on
the one at point to cancel, clone, redescribe, and reschedule it.</li>

<li>Thanks to Christian Tietze for implementing changes to how desktop
notifications are handled.  The overall effect should still be the
same for existing users, though the implementation has been redesigned.</li>

<li>Thanks to Damien Cassou who is now is my co-author due to multiple
contributions for <code>tmr.el</code>, the addition of the grid view, and the
splitting of TMR into numerous files.  Please consult the Git commit
log for the details.  (I still am the maintainer.)</li>

TMR was originally <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-02-introducing-tmr-el/">announced on my website</a>.  The code was developed as
part of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for several months before it was placed in its own
Git repo.  Even before the Elisp implementation, the core idea existed
as a standalone shell script, which is still part of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.
