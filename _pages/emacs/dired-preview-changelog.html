<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4d4e2b08-df93-4738-936b-70de1a056def">
<p>
The <code>dired-preview-mode-map</code> is active when <code>dired-preview-mode</code> is
enabled. Here are all the keys and corresponding commands it provides
right now:

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
With the exception of <code>dired-preview-hexl-toggle</code>, these are all new
commands.
</p>

<p>
My most used command among those is <code>dired-preview-open-dwim</code>, which
has a Do-What-I-Mean behaviour: If the file name matches
<code>dired-preview-media-extensions-regexp</code>,
<code>dired-preview-ignored-extensions-regexp</code>, or
<code>dired-preview-image-extensions-regexp</code>, then it opens it externally.
Otherwise, it visits the file in an Emacs buffer. Note that here we
include the <code>dired-preview-image-extensions-regexp</code> because while
Emacs can visit those in a buffer, it does not offer as much
functionality as other apps that specialise in handling image files.
</p>

<p>
[ Emacs uses the system default for those files when opening them externally. ]

<p>
Use this in your custom functions to run some code with the preview
window as the selected window. For example, here is a simple one from
our code base:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun dired-preview-page-down ()
  "Move a page down in the preview window.
This technically runs `scroll-up-command'."
  (interactive)
  (dired-preview-with-window
    (call-interactively 'scroll-up-command)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Remember to add them to the <code>dired-preview-mode-map</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="h:8c0034c1-9770-456f-b8db-40fe1db7754f"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Placeholder window prevents preview jumpiness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:8c0034c1-9770-456f-b8db-40fe1db7754f">
<p>
Wtih <code>dired-preview-ignored-extensions-regexp</code> we can exclude certain
files from being previewed. This is useful because, for example, Emacs
cannot display those files or do something useful with their contents,
or we just want to hide them (e.g. to omit GPG-encrypted files from
the preview).
</p>

<p>
In the past, <code>dired-preview-mode</code> would pop up a preview window for a
file that could be previewed and would then hide that window for
anything matching <code>dired-preview-ignored-extensions-regexp</code>. As a
result, windows would jump in and out of the frame layout. This could
be disorienting.
</p>

<p>
We now provide the user option <code>dired-preview-ignored-show-ignored-placeholders</code>
which shows a placeholder window when trying to preview an ignored
file. So as we move up and down the Dired buffer, the preview window
stays in place regardless if we are on an ignored file or not.
</p>

<p>
The default value of <code>dired-preview-ignored-show-ignored-placeholders</code>
is <code>t</code> because I think this is the better behaviour. Though users can
set it to <code>nil</code> to retain the old functionality.
</p>

Thanks to Álvaro Ramírez (xenodium) for the contribution. This was
done in pull request 15: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/pull/15">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/pull/15</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:250662ef-3fd3-4abe-8cf7-71c72ce4619c">
<p>
The old symbol is an alias for the new one and users will be notified
accordingly while updating.
</p>

<p>
This user option is for advanced users who want to customise where and
how <code>display-buffer</code> places the preview window. Before, we were
accepting only the symbol of a function that would return an
appropriate action alist. Now we accept either a function&rsquo;s symbol or
an action alist directly.
</p>

<p>
Examples of both:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Use a function that returns an action alist:
(setq dired-preview-display-action-alist #'dired-preview-display-action-alist-dwim)

;; Use an action alist directly:
(setq dired-preview-display-action-alist
      '((display-buffer-in-side-window)
        (side . bottom)
        (window-height . 0.2)
        (preserve-size . (t . t))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Check our <code>dired-preview-display-action-alist-dwim</code> for inspiration if
you want to have a function that returns an action alist based on,
say, the width of the frame.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:68fd4a03-7ca9-489c-93bc-efdaf8faaefc">
<p>
When we mark a file for deletion, Dired moves the point to the next
line. Before, this would not trigger a preview of the updated
file-at-point. Now it should work as expected.
</p>

<p>
Technically, we check if the last command is among those stored in the
variable <code>dired-preview-trigger-commands</code>. If you think there are
more commands we need to include there, just let me know.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:e3652b69-aa81-4b71-9887-81052ff7f9f7">
<p>
In the past, entering a new directory would not trigger a preview: it
would wait for some motion before doing so. This could make it seem
that the mode was not enabled in the current buffer. Now, the preview
shows up immediately.

As the documentation of this mode suggests:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.
This is not an ordinary major mode; it alters some aspects
of the current mode’s behavior, but not all; also, you can exit
Hexl mode and return to the previous mode using C-c C-c.

<p>
The <code>C-c C-c</code> key binding toggles the mode, in case you want to see
the raw output.

Before, we would delay the execution of the mode hooks to speed things
up. Though this came at the cost of (i) making the buffer less capable
and (ii) forcing us to handle the execution of those hooks at a later
stage when they would be needed, which proved to be error-prone in a
number of scenaria.

Each file type will thus have its own method on how to display the
contents in a buffer. The idea is to make this easier to extend. The
goal is to have methods that can preview PDFs and images without
blocking Emacs. Other file types can be considered as well, though
those two are the immediate priority.

The <code>dired-preview-mode</code> is a local minor mode, while

The idea for a global and a local mode is to empower the user to
toggle the functionality on demand, such as when they are in a meeting
and want to disable/enable previews in a given context.

During the development phase, I had made an error regarding the scope

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:c298121a-5ba4-408b-b063-14022c307c47">
<p>
In the original design, previews were triggered by bespoke
<code>dired-preview</code> commands that were remapped to <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> in Dired
buffers.  This had several downsides, namely, (i) the other motions
would not pick up the trigger, (ii) we would have to remap all
possible motions, and (iii) the code was needlessly complex.
</p>

<p>
Currently, we install a local hook in the post-command phase, which
will trigger a preview if the previous command was a Dired motion.  In
future versions, we may expand the list of commands that we check for.

Thanks to Bruno Boal for discussing the user option and concomitant
function with me and for checking the relevant definitions.  This was
done via a private channel and the information is shared with

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:06e6249d-8755-450e-b65e-b8f999d982a4">
<p>
The idea of &ldquo;preview&rdquo; windows is that they are not ordinary windows
that the user can interact with.  As such, they are to be deleted when
some non-preview mode of action is taken.
</p>

<p>
Testing for such cases was extensive and required lots of changes to
the code base.  Thanks to Bruno Boal for performing the tests with me,
for brainstorming possible solutions, and for inspecting the
implementation details.  This was done via a private channel and the
information is shared with permission.

<p>
Before, <code>dired-preview</code> would attempt to produce a preview of named
pipes and sockets.  This was not intended and has since been
addressed.  Use &rsquo;file-regular-p&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;file-exists-p&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Karthik Chikmagalur for bringing this matter to my attention
and for recommending the use of <code>file-regular-p</code> instead of
<code>file-exists-p</code>:

<h3 id="h:d8ba0949-76b0-4d3a-b0f3-1bfb62280483"><span class="section-number-3">3.7.</span> Preview buffers are killed up to a cumulative size threshold</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d8ba0949-76b0-4d3a-b0f3-1bfb62280483">
<p>
In the original design, we were killing preview buffers all at once.
This was wasteful because all the work we were doing in the background
to, for example, fetch a large file was discarded even though the user
could theoretically request another preview of it.
</p>

<p>
The current approach is to keep around the newer buffers in order to
speed up potential requests for another preview.  Older buffers are
discarded starting from the oldest.  The clearance of older buffers is
done until we reach a cumulative size of what is specified as the
value of the variable <code>dired-preview--buffers-threshold</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the symbol includes double dashes, meaning that it is
intended for &ldquo;private&rdquo; (internal) purposes.  I am mentioning it here,
because this seems like a good candidate for a future user option,
subject to further refinements.
