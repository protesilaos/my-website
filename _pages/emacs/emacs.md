## Emacs Lisp Elements

A book that provides big picture view of the Emacs Lisp programming
language by combining prose with code. The goal is to give readers an
idea of how Elisp works by showing some of the main concepts or
patterns discernible in everyday code.

Some chapters are beginner-friendly, while others dive into deeper
waters. Though I think everything is still approachable, as I try to
explain basic concepts and take things one step at a time.

The book is not meant to be a replacement for the built-in Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual. It simply gives you enough information to reason
about Elisp. Once you start extending Emacs, the rest will follow
naturally.

I hope you enjoy it and continue to have fun with Emacs.

## Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.

[ Further down on this list I include more of my Denote-related packages. ]

## Modus themes

Highly accessible themes, conforming with the highest standard for
colour contrast between background and foreground values (WCAG AAA).
They also are optimised for users with red-green or blue-yellow colour
deficiency.

The themes are very customisable and provide support for a wide range
of packages.  Their manual is detailed so that new users can get
started, while it also provides custom code for all sorts of more
advanced customisations.

Since August 2020, the original Modus themes (`modus-operandi`,
`modus-vivendi`) are built into Emacs version 28 or higher. Emacs 28
ships with `modus-themes` version `1.6.0`. Emacs 29 includes version
`3.0.0`. Emacs 30 provides version `4.4.0`. Version 4 is a major
refactoring of how the themes are implemented and customized. Such
major versions are not backward-compatible due to the limited
resources at my disposal to support multiple versions of Emacs and of
the themes across the years.

## Ef (εὖ) themes

The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes` (also
designed by me).

Starting with version `2.0.0`, the `ef-themes` are built on top of the
`modus-themes`. This means that all customisation options of the Modus
themes apply to the Ef themes. Same for all Modus commands that load a
theme. Enable `ef-themes-take-over-modus-themes-mode` to set up this
arrangement (or enable `modus-themes-include-derivatives-mode` instead
to blend Ef and Modus into one collection).

  Embellishments, and Sparkles.

## Doric themes

The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.

+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes>
+ Backronym: Doric Only Really Intensifies Conservatively ... themes.

## Fontaine

Fontaine allows the user to define detailed font configurations and set
them on demand.  For example, one can have a `regular-editing` preset
and another for `presentation-mode` (these are arbitrary, user-defined
symbols): the former uses small fonts which are optimised for writing,
while the latter applies typefaces that are pleasant to read at
comfortable point sizes.

+ Backronym: Fonts, Ornaments, and Neat Typography Are Irrelevant in Non-graphical Emacs.

## spacious-padding

This package provides a global minor mode to increase the
spacing/padding of Emacs windows and frames.  The idea is to make
editing and reading feel more comfortable.  Enable the mode with `M-x
spacious-padding-mode`.  Adjust the exact spacing values by modifying
the user option `spacious-padding-widths`.

Inspiration for this package comes from [Nicolas Rougier's impressive
designs](https://github.com/rougier) and [Daniel Mendler's
`org-modern` package](https://github.com/minad/org-modern).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `spacious-padding`

  Desktop Divider Internals Neatly Generated.

## Beframe

`beframe` enables a frame-oriented Emacs workflow where each frame has
access only to the list of buffers visited therein.  In the interest of
brevity, we call buffers that belong to frames "beframed".

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `beframe`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/beframe>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/beframe-changelog>

+ Backronym: Buffers Encapsulated in Frames Realise Advanced
  Management of Emacs.

## Substitute

Efficiently replace targets in the buffer or context.

Substitute is a set of commands that perform text replacement (i)
throughout the buffer, (ii) limited to the current definition (per
`narrow-to-defun`), (iii) from point to the end of the buffer, and
(iv) from point to the beginning of the buffer.

These substitutions are meant to be as quick as possible and, as such,
differ from the standard `query-replace` (which I still use when
necessary). The provided commands prompt for substitute text and
perform the substitution outright, without moving the point.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `substitute`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/substitute>

+ Backronym: Some Utilities Built to Substitute Targets Independent of
  Their Utterances, Thoroughly and Easily.

## TMR

TMR is an Emacs package that provides facilities for setting timers
using a convenient notation.  Lots of commands are available to operate
on timers, while there also exists a tabulated view to display all
timers in a nice grid.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `tmr`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/tmr>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/tmr-changelog>
+ Git repositories:

  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tmr>
+ Backronym: TMR May Ring; Timer Must Run.

## aLtCaPs

The `altcaps` package is a small, focused-in-scope tool that helps
users communicate mockery or sarcasm effectively.  It does this by
alternating the letter casing of characters in the words it affects.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `altcaps`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/altcaps>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/altcaps-changelog>

  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/altcaps>
+ Backronyms: Alternating Letters Transform Casual Asides to Playful
  Statements.  ALTCAPS Lets Trolls Convert Aphorisms to Proper
  Shitposts.

## show-font

This package lets you preview a font inside of Emacs. It does so in
three ways:

- Prompt for a font on the system and display it in a buffer.
- List all known fonts in a buffer, with a short preview for each.
- Provide a major mode to preview a font whose file is among the
  installed ones.

Check out its sources:

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `show-font`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/show-font>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/show-font-changelog>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/show-font>
+ Sample pictures: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-09-10-emacs-show-font-0-1-0/>
+ Backronym: Should Highlight Only With the Family Of the Named Typeface.

## Logos

This package provides a simple approach to setting up a "focus mode".
It uses the `page-delimiter` (typically `^L`) or the outline together
with some commands to move between pages whether narrowing is in effect
or not.  It also provides some optional aesthetic tweaks which come into
effect when the buffer-local `logos-focus-mode` is enabled.  The manual
shows how to extend the code to achieve the desired result.

(all my videos since early 2022 use `logos`).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `logos`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/logos-changelog>

+ Video demo: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-11-emacs-logos-demo/>
+ Backronyms: `^L` Only Generates Ostensible Slides; Logos Optionally Goes through Outline Sections.

## Pulsar

This is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line
or region after a given function is invoked. Several user options
control the exact behaviour. [Watch the original demo](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-14-emacs-pulsar-demo/).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `pulsar`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/pulsar-changelog>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar>
+ Backronym: Pulsar Unquestionably Luminates, Strictly Absent the Radiation.

## Lin

Lin is a stylistic enhancement for Emacs' built-in `hl-line-mode`.  It
remaps the `hl-line` face (or equivalent) buffer-locally to a style that
is optimal for major modes where line selection is the primary mode of
interaction.

The idea is that `hl-line-mode` cannot work equally well for contexts
with competing priorities: (i) line selection, or (ii) simple line
highlight.  In the former case, the current line needs to be made
prominent because it carries a specific meaning of some significance in
the given context: the user has to select a line.  Whereas in the latter
case, the primary mode of interaction does not revolve around the line
highlight itself: it may be because the focus is on editing text or
reading through the buffer's contents, so the current line highlight is
more of a reminder of the point's location on the vertical axis.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `lin`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/lin-changelog>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/lin>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lin>
+ Backronym: LIN Is Noticeable.

## Cursory

Cursory lets users define preset configurations for the cursor. Those
cover the style of the cursor (e.g. box or bar), whether it is
blinking or not, and how fast, as well as the colour it uses. Having
distinct presets makes it easy to switch between, say, a "reading
mode" with an ambient cursor and a "presentation mode" with a cursor
that is more noticeable and thus easier to spot.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `cursory`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/cursory>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/cursory-changelog>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/cursory>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/cursory>
+ Backronym: Cursor Usability Requires Styles Objectively Rated Yearlong.

## Notmuch Indicator

This is a simple package that renders an indicator with an email count
of the `notmuch` index on the Emacs mode line.  The underlying mechanism
is that of `notmuch-count(1)`, which is used to find the number of items
that match the given search terms.  In practice, the user can define one
or more searches and display their counters.  These form a listing which
realistically is like: `@50 😱1000 💕0` for unread messages, bills, and
love letters, respectively.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `notmuch-indicator`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/notmuch-indicator>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/notmuch-indicator-changelog>
+ Git repositories:

  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/notmuch-indicator>
+ Backronym: notmuch-... Interested in Notmuch Data Indicators that
  Count Any Terms Ordinarily Requested.

## Dired Preview

This is a simple and robust package to automatically preview in a side
window the file at point in Dired buffers.  Preview windows are closed
when they are no longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if
they have not been used for other purposes beside previewing.  The
package provides several customisation options to control its
behaviour.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `dired-preview`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/dired-preview>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dired-preview>
+ Backronym: Directories Invariably Render Everything Decently; PDFs
  Require Extra Viewing Instructions for Emacs to Work.

## Standard themes

The `standard-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for
GNU Emacs. The `standard-light` and `standard-dark` emulate the
out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a
theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability,
and extensibility. Other themes are stylistic variations of those.

In practice, the Standard themes take the default style of the
font-lock and Org faces, complement it with a wider and harmonious
colour palette, address many inconsistencies, and apply established
semantic patterns across all interfaces by supporting a large number
of packages.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `standard-themes`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/standard-themes>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/standard-themes-changelog>
+ Sample pictures: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/standard-themes-pictures>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/standard-themes>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/standard-themes>
+ Backronym: Standard Themes Are Not Derivatives but the
  Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.

## Minibuffer Confines Transcended (mct.el)

Opinionated changes and enhancements to the default minibuffer
completion UI of Emacs:

- Live completions to update the results as you type.

- Passlist and blocklist of commands or completion categories to
  control whether the `*Completions*` buffer shows up eagerly.

- Other relevant options to control when the `*Completions*` are
  displayed.

- Per command or completion category sorting methods.

- A cleaner `*Completions*` buffer, optionally without a mode line.

- Commands to cycle from the minibuffer to the `*Completions*` and
  vice versa.

In essence, MCT is (i) a layer of interactivity on top of the
out-of-the-box completion experience, and (ii) glue code that
combines built-in functionalities to make the default completion
framework work like that of more featureful third-party options.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `mct`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct-changelog>
+ Git repositories:

+ Video demo: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-22-emacs-mct-demo/>
+ Backronym: Minibuffer Confines Transcended; Minibuffer and
  Completions in Tandem.

## Consult-Denote

Glue code to integrate my `denote` package with Daniel Mendler's
`consult`. The idea is to enhance minibuffer interactions, such as by
providing a preview of the file-to-linked/opened and by adding more
sources to the `consult-buffer` command.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `consult-denote`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/consult-denote>
+ Change log: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/consult-denote-changelog>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote>
+ Backronym: Consult-Orchestrated Navigation and Selection of
  Unambiguous Targets...denote.

## Denote Org (extras for integrating Denote with Org)

The `denote-org` package contains extra features that better integrate
Denote with Org mode. These used to be available as part of the main
`denote` package in a file called `denote-org-extras.el`, but now live
in this standalone package to main things easier to maintain and
understand.

With `denote-org`, users have Org-specific extensions such as dynamic
blocks, links to headings, and splitting an Org subtree into its own
standalone file. This package's official manual covers the
technicalities.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote-org`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-org>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org>
+ Backronym: Denote... Ordinarily Restricts Gyrations.

## Denote Sequence (Sequence notes or Folgezettel with Denote)

The `denote-sequence` package provides an optional extension to
~denote~ for naming files with a sequencing scheme. The idea is to
establish hiearchical relationships between files, such that the
contents of one logically follow or complement those of another.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote-sequence`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-sequence>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-sequence>
+ Backronym: Denote... Sequences Efficiently Queue Unsorted Entries
  Notwithstanding Curation Efforts.

## Denote Silo

The `denote-silo` package makes it easier to work with multiple
"silos", as explained in the Denote manual. In short, a "silo" is a
localised `denote-directory` that is not connected to the
default/global `denote-directory` and other silos.

The code of `denote-silo` used to be bundled up with the `denote`
package before version `4.0.0` of the latter and was available in the
file `denote-silo-extras.el`. Users of the old code will need to adapt
their setup to use the `denote-silo` package. This can be done by
replacing all instances of `denote-silo-extras` with `denote-silo`
across their configuration.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote-silo`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-silo>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-silo>
+ Backronym: Denote... Silos Insulate Localised Objects.

## Denote Journal (extras for dailies)

The `denote-journal` package makes it easier to use Denote for
journaling. While it is possible to use the generic `denote` command
(and related) to maintain a journal, this package defines extra
functionality to streamline the journaling workflow.

The code of `denote-journal` used to be bundled up with the `denote`
package before version `4.0.0` of the latter and was available in the
file `denote-journal-extras.el`. Users of the old code will need to
adapt their setup to use the `denote-journal` package. This can be
done by replacing all instances of `denote-journal-extras` with
`denote-journal` across their configuration.

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `denote-journal`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote-journal>
+ Git repository: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal>
+ Backronym: Denote... Journaling Obviously Utilises Reasonableness
  Notwithstanding Affectionate Longing.

## Denote Markdown

The `denote-markdown` package provides some convenience functions to
better integrate Markdown with Deonte. This is mostly about converting
links from one type to another so that they can work in different
applications (because Markdown does not have a standardised way to
define custom link types).

The code of `denote-markdown` used to be bundled up with the `denote`
package before version `4.0.0` of the latter and was available in the
file `denote-md-extras.el`. Users of the old code will need to adapt
their setup to use the `denote-markdown` package. This can be done by
replacing all instances of `denote-md-extras` with `denote-markdown`
across their configuration.

## sxhkdrc-mode

This is a major mode for editing `sxhkdrc` files. SXHKD is the Simple
X Hot Key Daemon which is commonly used in minimalist desktop sessions
on Xorg (I use it with bspwm, herbstluftwm, and i3wm). The `sxhkdrc`
file configures key chords, binding them to commands. For the
technicalities, read the man page `sxhkd(1)`.

## The official Emacs TUTORIAL in Greek

I am the author and maintainer of the `TUTORIAL.el_GR` file that is

code inside the `etc/tutorials/` directory. If you report a bug about
it with `M-x report-emacs-bug`, consider adding me in carbon copy

## Theme buffet

The `theme-buffet` package arranges to automatically change themes
during specific times of the day or at fixed intervals. The collection
of themes is customisable, with the default options covering the
built-in Emacs themes as well as my `modus-themes` and `ef-themes`.

Bruno Boal is the lead developer and I am a co-maintainer.

## Aporetic

This is not an "Emacs package" per se though I use it full time in my
Emacs setup (it complements my work on Emacs themes and `fontaine`, for
example).

Customised build of the Iosevka typeface, with a consistent rounded
style and overrides for almost all individual glyphs in both upright
(roman) and slanted (italic) variants. This is the successor to my
now-discontinued "Iosevka Comfy" fonts.

_Iosevka Comfy_ is a customised build of the Iosevka typeface, with a
consistent rounded style and overrides for almost all individual
glyphs in both roman (upright) and italic (slanted) variants.  Many
font families are available, covering a broad range of typographic
weights.  The README file in the git repository covers all the
technicalities.

## Mandoura

⚠️ WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Use MPV to play media files via Dired.

The name of this package is a reference to a Greek musical instrument
from the island of Crete.  Though according to the Oracle of Delphi,
it is a cryptic message for future generations: "MPV Access Needs
Dired to Output User's Requested Audio".

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `mandoura` (⛔ not available yet)
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/mandoura>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mandoura>
+ Backronym: MPV Access Needs Dired to Output User's Requested Audio.

## Research (research.el)

⚠️ WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Run shell searches and store them reproducibly in buffers.

The goal of `research.el` ("re-search" is a shorthand for "repeatable
search") is to provide a thin wrapper for shell invocations that
search for file names or file contents.  The output is stored in an
Emacs buffer which retains the parameters that generated it.  This
buffer can then repeat the command that created it by means of
`revert-buffer` (bound to `g` by default).  File paths are
automatically buttonised so that they can be used as links to the file
they reference.

RESEARCH provides the means to write the Emacs Lisp that wraps around
the desired shell invocation.  We call the resulting commands and the
buffers they generate "re-searchable".

## Agitate (experimental)

Agitate is a collection of commands or potentially useful functions
that expand on the available version control features of Emacs.  Those
are meant to complement a workflow that relies on the built-in Version
Control framework and its accoutrements (`diff-mode.el`,
`log-view.el`, `log-edit.el`, `vc-git.el`, and potentially others).

+ Package name (GNU ELPA): `agitate`
+ Official manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/agitate>
+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/agitate>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/agitate>
+ Backronym: Another Git Interface Trying to Agitate Tranquil Emacsers.

## Custom Emacs build for Arch Linux (PKGBUILD)

This is just like every other package recipe for Arch.  We provide a
PKGBUILD and then `pacman` does the rest.  The project's README file
describes the procedure. ⛔ For experts only!

+ Git repositories:
  + GitHub: <https://github.com/protesilaos/emacs-arch-linux-pkgbuild>
  + GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/emacs-arch-linux-pkgbuild>
+ Backronym for "PKGBUILD ... of Emacs": Package Knowhow Germane to
  Building Unapologetically Individuated Local Design ... of Emacs.
