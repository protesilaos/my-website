<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:96f16728-46c4-4e0a-9f5a-90e1a5241c93">
<p>
The new user option <code>mct-sort-by-command-or-category</code> determines how
completion candidates are sorted.
</p>

<p>
This is an alist where each element is of the form <code>(SYMBOLS . SORT-FUNCTION)</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>SYMBOLS</code> is either a symbol or a list of symbols. <code>SYMBOLS</code> can refer
to the symbol of a function or completion category. It can also be <code>t</code>,
which refers to the fallback value.
</p>

<p>
<code>SORT-FUNCTION</code> is a function that takes a list of strings and returns a
list of strings, sorting them accordingly.  Examples of a <code>SORT-FUNCTION</code>
are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>mct-sort-by-alpha</code></li>
<li><code>mct-sort-by-alpha-then-by-length</code></li>
<li><code>mct-sort-by-history</code></li>
<li><code>mct-sort-by-directory-then-by-file</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
To not perform any sorting on the completion candidates that match
<code>SYMBOLS</code> set <code>SORT-FUNCTION</code> to nil.
</p>

<p>
If there are conflicting configurations between a <code>SYMBOLS</code> function and
completion category, then the function takes precedence (for example
<code>find-file</code> is set to sort directories first whereas the <code>file</code>
completion category is set to sort by history).

<p>
Users of Emacs prior to version 31 do not have a built-in way to
inform them when they are dealing with a <code>completing-read-multiple</code>
minibuffer prompt. Emacs 31 introduces the user option <code>crm-prompt</code>
and its related functionality to tell the user what they need to know.
</p>

<p>
The <code>mct-completing-read-multiple-indicator</code> can be used in the
meantime to achieve the same results. It is set to a non-nil value by
default. Opt out by changing it to nil.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:14e286c9-5a32-4745-bd7a-f41036263e07">
<p>
This concerns the case where a command or completion category is part
of the <code>mct-completion-passlist</code> or when the user option
<code>mct-live-completion</code> is set to non-nil or <code>visible</code>. In such cases,
the completion candidates are on display and we want to keep them
there while performing a dynamic completion, such as with the
<code>find-file</code> command ("dynamic" in the sense that it returns a new list
of candidates to match the current path).
</p>

<p>
Persisting the <code>*Completions*</code> means that as we narrow the list, we
still see all the matching results.
</p>

<p>
In the past, we provided the option <code>mct-persist-dynamic-completion</code>
though we do not need it anymore.
</p>

<p>
I was inspired to make this change in response to a question posed by
Ryan Davis regarding the behaviour of <code>mct-persist-dynamic-completion</code>.
This was done in issue 7: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/issues/7">https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/issues/7</a>.

<li><p>
The command <code>mct-choose-completion-exit</code> no longer tries to expand
further. In the previous implementation it would try to match the
last known selection from the history when using a file prompt. For
example we have this workflow:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the previous prompt we type <code>/path/to/file/</code> and exit.</li>
<li>Now we type <code>/pa</code>, the completions pop up, we select <code>/path</code> and
invoke <code>mct-choose-completion-exit</code>. This wrongly expands into
<code>/path/foo/</code> instead of taking just <code>/path</code> (given that it has no
further input to determine an extension of that string).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now the command will do the right thing based on the user's input.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:39f6904b-a045-4539-aa66-76be822064f9">
<p>
In April 2022, I announced that I was discontinuing the development of
my <code>mct</code> package.  At the time, Emacs 29 was gaining new MCT-like
capabilities and I thought we would quickly reach a point where my
package would be superseded by built-in functionality.  The article I
published at the time:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/</a>.
</p>

<p>
About a year later and after receiving questions about MCT, I decided
to restart its development.  This was done in light of the realisation
that the built-in Emacs functionality was still not as opinionated as
MCT.  There are good reasons for this state of affairs, due to the
legacy of this important User Interface element and Emacs' policy to
not break stuff willy nilly.  Still, the fact remains that MCT can fit
in a very narrow niche for those who (i) like the built-in completions
and (ii) appreciate a few extra niceties.  What I wrote in March, 2023:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-25-emacs-restart-mct-development/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-25-emacs-restart-mct-development/</a>.
</p>

<p>
What does MCT offer that the built-in Emacs UI does not?  In short:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MCT provides a facility for "live completions", to automatically
update the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer given certain conditions.  A
number of user options control the specifics.</li>

<li>There are user options for a passlist and blocklist, which determine
what should automatically display the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer and be
live updated.  The passlist and the blocklist can target individual
commands, such as <code>find-file</code>, as well as completion categories like
<code>buffer</code>.  The manual includes a section with several known
completion categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To be clear: MCT builds on top of the built-in functionality and
should not compete with it.  Depending on my availability, I will try
to prepare patches for emacs.git to see whether at least some features
can be added directly to <code>mnibuffer.el</code> or related.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-h:6ee9aea9-91f3-47cf-aab3-984fe9e23157" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:6ee9aea9-91f3-47cf-aab3-984fe9e23157">MCT supports Emacs 29 or higher</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6ee9aea9-91f3-47cf-aab3-984fe9e23157">
<p>
MCT is highly opinionated about how the completions should work.  This
applies to the presentation of the completion candidates as well as
the behaviour of commands that cycle between the minibuffer and the
<code>*Completions*</code>, treating the two as a contiguous space.  In previous
versions of Emacs, MCT could not work exactly as intended due to
limitations in the underlying framework.  For example, the variable
<code>completions-format</code> gained the <code>one-column</code> value only in Emacs 28:
Emacs 27 supported grid views which are not intuitive as a vertical
list for up-down cycling between the candidates.
</p>

<p>
To make things easier to maintain, MCT only works with Emacs 29 or
higher.  The ~1 year hiatus has hopefully given users enough time to
assess their options.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:bf50160c-07e9-4625-af0a-5142d79ed35b">
<p>
For a while, MCT supported in-buffer completion via a minor mode that
would add all the needed functionality.  This was always problematic
due to underlying constrains and is thus no longer supported.  MCT is
designed to work exclusively with the minibuffer, where the behaviour
is more reliable.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, users can still get an MCT-like experience with these
settings, which affect the default UI (modify as you see fit):

Previous versions of MCT would prepend a <code>[CRM]</code> tag to the minibuffer

I do not intend to refashion MCT.  It works the way it was originally
intended to.  What I did is to streamline the code for compatibility
with Emacs 29 and tweak the custom commands to preserve the desired
cyclic behaviour between the minibuffer and the <code>*Completions*</code>.
</p>

<p>
Experiments such as integration with the <code>avy</code> package or the ability
to type-to-complete in the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer are abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Do not expect radical changes henceforth.  I shall monitor and/or
contribute to developments in core Emacs and am happy to forever
archive MCT if/when the default completion UI gains the capabilities
that, I think, make the user experience a little bit easier.

<p>
The user option <code>mct-completion-window-size</code> controls the maximum and
minimum height of the window where the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer is shown.
It accepts a cons cell in the form of <code>(MAX-HEIGHT . MIN-HEIGHT)</code>.  Valid
values are natural numbers (positive integers) or functions which return
such numbers.  The default is a combination of the two for the sake of
illustration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><code>(setq mct-completion-window-size (cons #'mct--frame-height-fraction 1))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
With this in place, mct will let the <code>*Completions*</code> grow up to 1/3 of the
frame's height (per the <code>mct--frame-height-fraction</code>).  When live
completion is performed (see the user option <code>mct-live-completion</code>), the
window will shrink to fit the candidates.
</p>

<p>
To make the <code>*Completions*</code> have a fixed height instead, simply set the
same number/function twice.
</p>

<p>
If set to nil, mct will simply not try to fit the Completions' buffer to
its window.

Quoting from the documentation of the <code>mct-persist-dynamic-completion</code>
user option:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When non-nil, keep dynamic completion live.
</p>

<p>
Without any intervention from MCT, the default Emacs behavior for
commands such as <code>find-file</code> or for a <code>file</code> completion category is to hide
the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer after updating the list of candidates in a
non-exiting fashion (e.g. select a directory and expect to continue
typing the path).  This, however, runs contrary to the interaction model
of MCT when it performs live completions, because the user expects the
Completions' buffer to remain visible while typing out the path to the
file.
</p>

<p>
When this user option is non-nil (the default) it makes all non-exiting
commands keep the <code>*Completions*</code> visible when updating the list of
candidates.
</p>

<p>
This applies to prompts in the <code>file</code> completion category whenever the
user selects a candidate with <code>mct-choose-completion-no-exit</code>,
<code>mct-edit-completion</code>, <code>minibuffer-complete</code>, <code>minibuffer-force-complete</code>
(i.e. any command that does not exit the minibuffer).
</p>

<p>
The two exceptions are (i) when the current completion session runs a
command or category that is blocked by the <code>mct-completion-blocklist</code> or
(ii) the user option <code>mct-live-completion</code> is nil.
</p>

<p>
The underlying rationale:
</p>

<p>
Most completion commands present a flat list of candidates to choose
from.  Picking a candidate concludes the session.  Some prompts,
however, can recalculate the list of completions based on the selected
candidate.  A case in point is <code>find-file</code> (or any command with the <code>file</code>
completion category) which dynamically adjusts the completions to show
only the elements which extend the given file system path.  We call such
cases "dynamic completion".  Due to their particular nature, these need
to be handled explicitly.  The present user option is provided primarily
to raise awareness about this state of affairs.

<p>
The <code>mct-region-completions-format</code> used to be the only user option that
affected the <code>mct-region-mode</code>.  It was removed in the interest of
simplicity and to avoid potential complications or bugs.  Having
separate user options for <code>mct-minibuffer-mode</code> and <code>mct-region-mode</code> would
inevitably lead to duplication and a considerable expansion of the code
base with all sorts of exceptions and checks.

<p>
In-buffer completion now uses the same <code>mct-completions-format</code> as its
minibuffer-based counterpart.

Starting with commit <code>a46421446f</code> to emacs.git (by me) users have the

<li>Version <code>0.4.1</code> fixed a regression with an out-of-bounds motion when
performing certain motions in the <code>*Completions*</code> with a numeric

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6ee71a37-cada-43af-93b3-a1d65e2be4a8">
<p>
Emacs distinguishes between two types of completion: one that involves
the minibuffer and another for text expansion inside regular buffers.
MCT has supported the former case since its inception, as hinted by its
original name ("Minibuffer and Completions in Tandem"), but would not
work as intended for in-buffer completion.
</p>

<p>
This changes with the introduction of a new global minor mode:
<code>mct-region-mode</code>.  What once was <code>mct-mode</code> is now defined as
<code>mct-minibuffer-mode</code> to better denote the scope of the given
functionality.
</p>

<p>
With <code>mct-region-mode</code> enabled, users get a simplified subset of the
familiar MCT functionality when typing <code>TAB</code> or <code>C-M-i</code> to complete the
text-at-point in any major-mode that supports
<code>completion-at-point-functions</code> (e.g. programming modes or Org).
</p>

<p>
<code>mct-region-mode</code> is considered experimental and unstable.  Users are
encouraged to report any bugs as well as recommend ways to improve its
functionality or interaction model.  The manual has been updated to
cover all the relevant details.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Mendler, who is the developer of the <code>vertico</code> and <code>corfu</code> packages
(alternatives to <code>mct-minibuffer-mode</code> and <code>mct-region-mode</code>, respectively),
was intstrumental in making <code>mct-region-mode</code> happen.  Daniel's patches
helped with everything from (i) the proper functioning of
<code>mct-region-mode</code>, (ii) the separation between <code>mct-minibuffer-mode</code> and
<code>mct-region-mode</code>, (iii) the overall setup of the minor modes, and (iv)
lots of other crucial details of the overall design of MCT.  In short:
there would be no <code>mct-region-mode</code> without Daniel's contributions.  Any
remaining errors or omissions are my own.
</p>

<p>
Given this new functionality, we can now joke that "MCT" stands for
"Minibuffer Confines Transcended".

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MCT now works on Emacs 27.  This was not possible in the past because
<code>mct-mode</code> was originally designed to operate with the <code>one-column</code> style
of the <code>completions-format</code>, which was added in Emacs 28.  To make
everything behave intuitively, several parts had to be abstracted and
refactored (the changelog of version <code>0.2.0</code> (further below) covers
everything not mentioned here).</li>

<li>The scenaria where the functionality was thoroughly tested involve all
the available formats and cover commands that fulfil the following
criteria:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Plain completion candidates, as in <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.</li>
<li>Dynamic completion like that of <code>find-file</code>.</li>
<li>Annotated candidates, as seen in <code>describe-symbol</code> for versions of
Emacs 28 or higher.</li>
<li>Commands where candidates are grouped by heading, as done by various
extensions of the <code>consult</code> package, such as <code>consult-imenu</code>.</li>
<li>Commands where no completion category is associated with them.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The only change which is visible to the user is the implementation
of a bespoke overlay to highlight the current candidate.  In
previous versions, this was provided by the built-in <code>hl-line-mode</code>,
though that does not work as intended with either the <code>vertical</code> or
<code>horizontal</code> layouts of the <code>completions-format</code> as it covers the whole
line instead of the candidate at point.</li>

<li>The highlight extends to the edge of the window when the <code>one-column</code>
format is used for the <code>completions-format</code> (Emacs 28 or higher).  In
the other views it stretches from the beginning to the end of the
completion candidate.</li>

<li>There is a new command that is active in the minibuffer which allows
to complete and exit immediately: <code>C-RET</code> (<code>mct-complete-and-exit</code>).  This
economises on key presses when all the user wants is to select the
top-most candidate (or last highlighted one) without first switching
to the Completions' buffer and then confirming it from there (<code>RET</code> in
the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer completes and exits directly).

<li><p>
The user option <code>mct-live-completion</code> controls how and when the
Completions' buffer should be placed in a window and be updated live
in response to user feedback.  Copying from the doc string:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
mct-live-completion is a variable defined in ‘mct.el’.
</p>

<p>
Its value is t
</p>

<p>
Control auto-display and live-update of Completions' buffer.
</p>

<p>
When nil, the user has to manually request completions, using the
regular activating commands.  The Completions' buffer is never updated
live to match user input.  Updating has to be handled manually.  This
is like the out-of-the-box minibuffer completion experience.
</p>

<p>
When set to the value <code>visible</code>, the Completions' buffer is live
updated only if it is visible.  The actual display of the completions
is still handled manually.  For this reason, the <code>visible</code> style does
not read the <code>mct-minimum-input</code>, meaning that it will always try to
live update the visible completions, regardless of input length.
</p>

<p>
When non-nil (the default), the Completions' buffer is automatically
displayed once the <code>mct-minimum-input</code> is met and is hidden if the
input drops below that threshold.  While visible, the buffer is
updated live to match the user input.
</p>

<p>
Note that every function in the <code>mct-completion-passlist</code> ignores this
option altogether.  This means that every such command will always
show the Completions' buffer automatically and will always update its
contents live.  Same principle for every function declared in the
<code>mct-completion-blocklist</code>, which will always disable both the
automatic display and live updating of the Completions' buffer.

<li>Thanks to Jonathan Irving for the feedback in issue 4:

<li>As with all buffers, the placement of the <code>*Completions*</code> can be
controlled with the <code>display-buffer</code> machinery.  The default is to show
the completions at the bottom of the frame, though users can easily
move it to, say, the left side window.  The doc string of the user
option <code>mct-display-buffer-action</code> explains how to do so.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the initial implementation in commit
<code>436b24e</code> (was sent via email as a patch).</li>

<li>Thanks to Kostadin Ninev for reporting a bug where the Completions'
buffer would proliferate during completion:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/3">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/3</a>.  It was fixed by
Philip Kaludercic in commit <code>51c1e17</code>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>MCT now supports all the available styles of the <code>completions-format</code>,
whereas the original design was only meant to work with the value
<code>one-column</code>, which was introduced in Emacs 28.  The user option is
<code>mct-completions-format</code>.  If that variable is set with <code>setq</code>, the
<code>mct-mode</code> has to be restarted manually for changes to take effect
(setting the variable through <code>customize-set-variable</code> (and related)
handles the mode reloading automatically).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch in commit <code>b392b0b</code>.</li>

<li>Several changes were then made to ensure that the cyclic motions
that move between the <code>*Completions*</code> and the minibuffer work
intuitively in a grid view.  In short: <code>C-n</code>, <code>C-p</code> or the down/up arrow
keys, perform a vertical motion, while the left/right arrow keys
move laterally.  Prior to those changes, <code>C-n</code> or down arrow as well
as <code>C-p</code> or up arrow, would perform a lateral motion as that is
internally the meaning of the next/previous completion candidate.</li>

<li>The command <code>mct-choose-completion-number</code> was updated to throw a user
error when a grid view is active.  That is because it is designed to
jump to a given line number, which only works as intended when there
is only one candidate per line. (Perhaps a future release should
overlay characters over candidates in the grid view to select them
directly.)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The <code>mct-mode</code> no longer sets the <code>completions-detailed</code> variable.  That
is a matter of user preference.  It is not integral to the
functionality of MCT.</li>

<li>Emacs 28 provides infrastructure for commands to group candidates
based on their contents.  These groups can have their own heading in
the Completions' buffer, as well as a separator.  Overall, it makes
things look more organised.  The commands <code>mct-next-completion-group</code>
and <code>mct-previous-completion-group</code> move between those headings.  While
in the <code>*Completions*</code> buffer, they are bound to <code>M-n</code> and <code>M-p</code>,
respectively.  Thanks to James Norman Vladimir Cash for the

The <code>TAB</code> key in the Completions' buffer never exits the minibuffer (the
command is <code>mct-choose-completion-no-exit</code>).  Instead, it expands the
current candidate in the minibuffer and switches focus to it.  Before,
this behaviour would only happen in <code>find-file</code> and related prompts, but
consistency/predictability is better.
</p>

<p>
[ By contrast, <code>RET</code> (<code>mct-choose-completion-exit</code>) in the Completions
  buffer always exits with the candidate at point. ]
</p>

<p>
Note that in this context "exit" means to close the session and accept
the current input.
</p></li>

<li>There is a new heuristic to deal with commands that <code>let</code> bind the
<code>crm-separator</code> (e.g. <code>org-set-tags-command</code> sets the separator to <code>:</code>).
This is used to make <code>M-RET</code> (<code>mct-choose-completion-dwim</code>) in the
Completions buffer work in all <code>completing-read-multiple</code> contexts.
Thanks to James Norman Vladimir Cash for contributing the heuristic in
merge request 1:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/1</a>.</li>

<li>The aforementioned <code>M-RET</code> command used to have the same effect as <code>RET</code>
when not in a <code>completing-read-multiple</code> prompt ("CRM prompt").  This
has now been revised to behave like <code>TAB</code> instead (as described further
above), which is consistent with the ordinary behaviour of <code>M-RET</code> in
CRM prompts where it appends the candidate at point to the minibuffer
without exiting.</li>

<li>The check for <code>display-line-numbers-mode</code> tests whether it is bound,
thus avoiding possible errors.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the
patch in commit <code>6bd2457</code>.</li>

<li>Made several improvements to doc strings and various snippets of code.</li>
