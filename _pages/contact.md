Feel free to send me your message regarding the content of this
website (blog posts, coding stuff, books, etc.). I normally reply
within 48 hours (usually much sooner). If you think you have not
received a message from me after a reasonable amount of time, check
your "spam" folder or email me again.

I provide coaching and services on Emacs, Linux, and Life in general.
Check the details and email me about it, if it interests you (though
you can send me a message regardless): <https://protesilaos.com/coach>

I do not use social media.

## Citations (optional)

You do not need permission to reuse or adapt my work.  Just do it under
copyleft terms.  See the license page: <https://protesilaos.com/license>.

I put this here because I got asked about it a few times: I do not care
what format you use to cite my articles.  Simply contribute to a free
society by respecting copyleft.  If you insist though, here is an idea:

Protesilaos: _TITLE_, YYYY-MM-DD, LINK

## PGP encryption for emails (optional)

You are welcome to send me an encrypted email. Do it even if you want
to test how the thing works. Just remember to also give me your public
key, so that I can respond to you.

Information about my keys is available here: <https://protesilaos.com/pgp>.

I encourage you to learn how to use encryption for your email
communications and establish it as your default method for trusted
contacts.  You do not need to be a tech wizard to implement it.  Get
started with this excellent guide by the Free Software Foundation on
[email self-defence](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/).
