## Profile

I am a philosopher living in the mountains of Cyprus at a house I
built myself which I affectionately call "the hut." I spend my free
time programming on GNU Emacs, writing essays on a wide range of life
issues, and doing infrastructure work around my house. My background
is diverse and reflects my intellectual curiosity as well as
consistently high work ethic.

In my teens I was a semi-professional football (soccer) player. I had
to quit that career path due to an untimely injury. I also worked as
an assistant to a land surveyor and a motorcycle mechanic.

I left my hometown in Greece to go to Cyprus for university studies. I
got a degree in European Politics, Economics, and Law. My family could
not afford any of my expenses. I covered it all by working in parallel
to studying. In practice, I did not have a "student life" because that
was a luxury I could not afford. If I was not studying, I was working.
To that end, I was employed as a bartender in the tourism sector, a
receptionist, a waiter, and a construction worker.

After my studies in mid-2011 and up until ~2016 I got involved in
politics-related fields, starting with the role of an accredited
parliamentary assistant to a Member of the European Parliament. I was
one of the people doing the technical, behind-the-scenes work that
goes into law-making. I also worked as an independent researcher and
external contractor. My specialisation was in the Economic and
Monetary Union.

I decided to quit politics and relocate to the mountains of Cyprus. I
did it to take control of my experience, prioritise my values, and
remain honest. I thus continued to live by doing construction work and
agriculture-related menial tasks, until I decided to provide
one-on-one coaching services on Emacs, Linux, and general Life issues.
This has been my job since early 2023. More details here:
<https://protesilaos.com/coach/>.

Since the summer of 2023, I live at "the hut", which I homesteaded on
a piece of land that used to be a vineyard. The project is ongoing, as
I continue to expand its infrastructure and further improve the living
conditions it makes possible.

My diverse experiences combined with my philosophical thinking empower
me to create connections between seemingly unrelated fields. The
insights I develop are thus original and probably thought-provoking.

## About protesilaos.com and all my publications

This website has been online since 2011. It contains more than 1500
in-depth entries on a wide range of topics, all of which are available
under the appropriate _copyleft_ terms that ensure end user
freedom—see the [license and resources](https://protesilaos.com/license/) page. I usually make
several new publications per week which, if nothing else, shows my
uninterrupted commitment to this project. Read, learn, think, and
reach your own conclusions.

To the question of "where do I start from", my answer is that it does
not matter. Each article of mine either stands on its own or links to
related entries. Pick any of the following subsections of my website:

<ul>
  {% for i in site.data.indices %}
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="{{ i.url | absolute_url }}">{{ i.name }}</a> :: </strong> {{ i.description }}
    </p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## Emacs and programming

As I state in the description of my GitHub profile:

> At what point does a tinkerer become a programmer, provided no
> formal background in the latter?

I am a self-taught programmer who enjoys learning by doing. I maintain
more than 20 Emacs packages and continue to make contributions to the
benefit of the Emacs community and free software at-large. Find all
the relevant projects here: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs>.
