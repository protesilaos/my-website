## Profile

In my teens I was a semi-professional football (soccer) player and, at
times, an assistant to a land surveyor and a motorcycle mechanic.

During my university years I was employed as a bartender, construction
worker, receptionist, waiter, etc.  I hold a Bachelor's degree in
European Politics, Economics, and Law.

After my studies in mid-2011 and up until ~2016 I got involved in
politics-related fields (parliamentary assistant at the European
Parliament, independent researcher and external contractor, etc.), with
a specialisation in the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union.

Now I am providing coaching services on Emacs, Linux, and general Life
issues.  More details here: <https://protesilaos.com/coach/>.

Those granted, I am just a philosopher.  I spend much of my time doing
philosophy, whether that is by thinking or writing.  I also program my
custom computing environment and generally try to do things my way for
their inherent recreational or educational value.

I care about human connections and hope my publications will help in
that regard.

As of Spring 2023 I am building a hut (i.e. makeshift construction) in
the mountains of Cyprus.  I am doing this to address my accommodation
woes: I am priced out of the market for rent.

### Work on philosophy

I talk, write, and do philosophy.  I generally try to express myself
in plain terms and make my thoughts relatable to everyone.  I consider
my theories "practical", in the sense that I put them to the test and
live by those precepts.

My website contains three distinct sections with philosophical
content:

1. The "books and standalone essays" contains my core work:
   <https://protesilaos.com/books>.
2. The "general commentary on life" consists of anonymised excerpts
   from exchanges I have with other people and/or entries from my
   journal: <https://protesilaos.com/commentary/>.
3. The "interpretations" cover my philosophical commentary on works of
   art (typically Greek songs which I translate):
   <https://protesilaos.com/interpretations>.

As of 2022-10-07, I am doing videos on philosophy where I walk in
nature and expound on my thoughts.  Find those in the aforementioned
"books" section.  This effort is made possible by a 500 EUR donation I
received which allowed me to buy a smartphone (Samsung A53), its
charging adapter, and a selfie stick.

### Work on GNU Emacs

I maintain lots of packages for Emacs, including the `modus-themes`
which are a part of core Emacs and the increasingly popular `denote`
note-taking system.  Find all my packages here:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs>.  And follow my coding blog for
relevant updates: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog>.

Sometimes I blend programming with philosophy, as made evident by such
questions as the one that populates my GitLab/GitHub profile's
description:

> At what point does a tinkerer become a programmer, provided no formal
> background in the latter?

Or in some of the older videos I made which are nominally about a text
editor but I actually talk philosophy, such as:

+ [Why Emacs itself is my “favourite Emacs
  package”](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-10-21-emacs-favourite-package/)
  (2020-10-21).
+ [Moral lessons from free software and GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-04-16-emacs-moral-lessons/)
  (2021-04-16).
+ [Live stream: Emacs as a 'second brain' and
  mindfulness](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-08-31-emacs-second-brain-mindfulness/)
  (2021-08-31).
+ [Live stream: Emacs and the Unix
  philosophy](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-09-22-live-stream-emacs-unix/)
  (2021-09-22).
+ [EmacsConf 2021: How Emacs made me appreciate software
  freedom](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-12-21-emacsconf2021-freedom/)
  (published on 2021-12-21---the actual event was on November 27-28, 2021).
+ [LibrePlanet 2022: Living in freedom with GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-emacs-living-freedom/)
  (published on 2022-03-22---the actual event was on March 19-20,
  2022).
+ [EmacsConf 2023: hyperdrive.el peer-to-peer filesystem with Joseph
  Turner and
  Protesilaos](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-12-23-emacsconf2023-hyperdrive/)
  (published on 2023-12-23---the actual event was on Decemeber 2-3,
  2023).

In a manner of speaking, I just talk to programmers about philosophy and
to philosophers about programming.

## Awards

On 2022-03-19 the Free Software Foundation awarded me the _2021 Award
for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor_.  I received it in my
mail in late August 2022.  Here is the announcement, which also includes
all links to the backstory, as well as a video of me showing the
physical item:

(pictures too!).

In May 2023 I received the _Google Open Source Peer Bonus Program_
award for my Emacs `modus-themes`:

What I wrote in the past may not represent my current views.  I review,
change, refine my beliefs as part of a life of research and reflection.
If you are looking for consistency, a dogma to follow, a narcissist to

_you should not follow me_, for I am not going anywhere in particular.

1. My active Git repositories are on GitHub. Some projects have
   mirrors on GitLab.
2. The Douyin/TikTok account is not maintained by me (I don't know
   Chinese).  This is done by friends of mine in China who want to
   help me by sharing some of my publications.
3. I seldom use IRC/Reddit.  The username is there "just in case" I
   ever need it.
