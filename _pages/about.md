## Profile

In my teens I was a semi-professional football (soccer) player and, at
times, an assistant to a land surveyor and a motorcycle mechanic.

During my university years I was employed as a bartender, construction
worker, receptionist, waiter, etc.  I hold a Bachelor's degree in
European Politics, Economics, and Law.

After my studies in mid-2011 and up until ~2016 I got involved in
politics-related fields (parliamentary assistant at the European
Parliament, independent researcher and external contractor, etc.), with
a specialisation in the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union.

Now I am providing coaching services on Emacs, Linux, and general Life
issues.  More details here: <https://protesilaos.com/coach/>.

Those granted, I am just a philosopher.  I spend much of my time doing
philosophy, whether that is by thinking or writing.  I also program my
custom computing environment and generally try to do things my way for
their inherent recreational or educational value.

I care about human connections and hope my publications will help in
that regard.

As of Spring 2023 I am building a hut (i.e. makeshift construction) in
the mountains of Cyprus.  I am doing this to address my accommodation
woes: I am priced out of the market for rent.

### Work on philosophy

I talk, write, and do philosophy.  I generally try to express myself
in plain terms and make my thoughts relatable to everyone.  I consider
my theories "practical", in the sense that I put them to the test and
live by those precepts.

My website contains three distinct sections with philosophical
content:

1. The "books and standalone essays" contains my core work:
   <https://protesilaos.com/books>.
2. The "general commentary on life" consists of anonymised excerpts
   from exchanges I have with other people and/or entries from my
   journal: <https://protesilaos.com/commentary/>.
3. The "interpretations" cover my philosophical commentary on works of
   art (typically Greek songs which I translate):
   <https://protesilaos.com/interpretations>.

As of 2022-10-07, I am doing videos on philosophy where I walk in
nature and expound on my thoughts.  Find those in the aforementioned
"books" section.  This effort is made possible by a 500 EUR donation I
received which allowed me to buy a smartphone (Samsung A53), its
charging adapter, and a selfie stick.

### Work on GNU Emacs

I maintain lots of packages for Emacs, including the `modus-themes`
which are a part of core Emacs and the increasingly popular `denote`
note-taking system.  Find all my packages here:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs>.  And follow my coding blog for
relevant updates: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog>.

Sometimes I blend programming with philosophy, as made evident by such
questions as the one that populates my GitLab/GitHub profile's
description:

> At what point does a tinkerer become a programmer, provided no formal
> background in the latter?

Or in some of the older videos I made which are nominally about a text
editor but I actually talk philosophy, such as:

+ [Why Emacs itself is my “favourite Emacs
  package”](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-10-21-emacs-favourite-package/)
  (2020-10-21).
+ [Moral lessons from free software and GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-04-16-emacs-moral-lessons/)
  (2021-04-16).
+ [Live stream: Emacs as a 'second brain' and
  mindfulness](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-08-31-emacs-second-brain-mindfulness/)
  (2021-08-31).
+ [Live stream: Emacs and the Unix
  philosophy](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-09-22-live-stream-emacs-unix/)
  (2021-09-22).
+ [EmacsConf 2021: How Emacs made me appreciate software
  freedom](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-12-21-emacsconf2021-freedom/)
  (published on 2021-12-21---the actual event was on November 27-28, 2021).
+ [LibrePlanet 2022: Living in freedom with GNU
  Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-22-libreplanet-emacs-living-freedom/)
  (published on 2022-03-22---the actual event was on March 19-20,
  2022).

In a manner of speaking, I just talk to programmers about philosophy and
to philosophers about programming.  Another relevant introduction is [My
'Brown University Interviews' on Emacs and
life](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-29-interview-brown-uni-mag-emacs-life/)
(2021-10-29).  A comprehensive [interview with InfoQ China on Emacs and
life](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-10-interview-infoq-china-emacs-life/)
may also prove useful (2022-04-10).  Same for the one I did with
_Syntopikon_ on [Emacs, politics,
philosophy](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-04-15-interview-syntopikon-emacs-life/) (2023-04-15).

On 2022-03-19 the Free Software Foundation awarded me the _2021 Award
for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor_.  I received it in my
mail in late August 2022.  Here is the announcement, which also includes
all links to the backstory, as well as a video of me showing the
physical item:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-09-01-emacs-fsf-award/>
(pictures too!).

In May 2023 I received the _Google Open Source Peer Bonus Program_
award for my Emacs `modus-themes`:
<https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/05/google-open-source-peer-bonus-program-announces-first-group-of-winners-2023.html>.
Relevant essay of mine on _Accessibility and software freedom_:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-05-11-accessibility-software-freedom/>.

In July 2023, the Free Software Foundation published a "working
together" series that features a brief comment of mine on GNU Emacs.

These are articles other people have written in which I am mentioned
prominently.  I do not know if the list is exhaustive.

entries on a wide range of topics, all of which are available under the
appropriate _copyleft_ terms that ensure end user freedom—see the

learn, think, and reach your own conclusions.

What I wrote in the past may not represent my current views.  I review,
change, refine my beliefs as part of a life of research and reflection.
If you are looking for consistency, a dogma to follow, a narcissist to
idolise, you need to look elsewhere.  It is important to understand that
_you should not follow me_, for I am not going anywhere in particular.
