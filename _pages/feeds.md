A web "feed", also known as "RSS feed" or "Atom feed" depending on
technicalities, is a stream of data that gets updated every time
something new is added to the webpage it tracks.  For example, a blog's
feed will contain all newly published articles.

The usefulness of this tool is that it allows specialised programs or
applications—feed readers—to automatically check multiple websites for
updates, based on the list of feed subscriptions.  The user gets all new
information in a centralised place—the reader application—rather than
manually checking every single website.

Think of the feed reader as your "unified inbox" to all updates from the
websites you follow.

To subscribe, the user will typically have to copy the feed's link into
their reader's appropriate place.  Most applications/services make this
straightforward.  Note that "subscribe" is just a standard copy-paste of
a link.  You do not share private information with the website that
provides the feed.

Feeds are best suited for following websites that do not post updates
very often, like personal blogs.  Never miss the occasional publication.
Conversely, they are not great for tracking high frequency sites, such
as news outlets.  The sheer volume of publications will quickly become
overwhelming.  **Keep the list of RSS subscriptions limited to the type
of content you do not want to miss.**
