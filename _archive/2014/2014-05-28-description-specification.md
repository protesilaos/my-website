There is a distinction to be made between having knowledge _of_ X and knowledge _about_ X. The former proceeds from comprehension, the latter from description. Consider the following phrases:

  1. Jocelyn has curly hair.
  2. Jocelyn, my neighbour, has curly hair.
  3. Jocelyn, my next door neighbour and colleague, has curly hair.

Phrase 1, **P1**, can correspond to a state of affairs, or not; it may be true or false, thus, it may denote something or nothing. **P1** as presented amounts to a _claim_ on truthfulness, so that &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn has curly hair**_&#8220;. On the face of it, reference is made to a definite &#8220;Joselyn&#8221;, although its specificity remains obscure, since the name &#8220;Joselyn&#8221; is not _necessarily_ exclusive to a unique entity. Then, should the correspondence of **P1** to a state of affairs be true, the information conveyed amounts to knowledge _about_ the fact that _&#8220;**P1** is true&#8221;_ or else _&#8220;**It is true Jocelyn has curly hair** is true_&#8220;.

In spite of having attained knowledge about a state of affairs — about its surface aspects —, the _substantive_ aspects of &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; and its properties remain largely unknown. At first, &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; may be the name of a human, yet it might as well be that of a pet, say, a dog. Secondly, we only have proximate acquaintance with the enumerated properties of &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221;, namely &#8220;curly hair&#8221;, for we may only _assume_ what these actually are. The linguistic terms in use might indeed be found in the milieu of everyday language and their intended meaning may be enforced by intersubjective norms and social institutions. Even so, this in itself is no firm foundation on which to establish _with certainty_ that the properties characteristic of &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; are indeed whatever is contained in the ordinary meaning of the applicable linguistic terms.

The tension can become more evident when the words themselves are not familiar or when they constitute a concept or set thereof that is unidentifiable at the outset, such as when they acquire a peculiar meaning in a certain context, as they do, for example, in scientific parlance. We may indeed recognise the need to be inquisitive _beyond_ the familiarity of appearances when presented with a phrase such as &#8220;_The filamentous biomaterial that grows from follicles found in the dermis_ of Jocelyn is curly&#8221; (scientific jargon found on <a title="Wikipedia entry on hair" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair#Description" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>). Though one may venture to penetrate the hermeneutic patina of **P1**, the phrase _in and of itself_ will not provide grounds for certainty but, at the very best, for justified beliefs on the likeliest of possible conditions applicable.

The degree of ambiguity peculiar to **P1** — the low specificity value it exhibits — prevents us from unequivocally affirming that it can be analysable from &#8220;_**P1 **is true_&#8221; or its equivalent &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn has curly hair** is true_&#8221; to something more descriptive such as e.g. _&#8220;**It is true that Jocelyn is human** and **it is true Jocelyn has curly hair** is true&#8221;_. Given that we cannot proceed from certainty to postulate the truthfulness of the latter, we might instead opt to concede the _possibility_ of such reformulation being valid in its correspondence to a state of affairs, so that &#8220;_**P1** is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sometimes</span> true_&#8220;.

The same approach is to be adopted for phrases 2 and 3, **P2** and **P3** respectively. For the sake of brevity, the reader need not be subjected to a tedious repetition of the aforementioned, but only be provided with the elements of analysis that are new and whose consideration can offer further insight into the matter.

With regard to **P2**, the degree of specificity relative to **P1** is to be treated as higher due to the presence of the explanatory statement &#8220;my neighbour&#8221;. The latter can only signify a human if **P2** is stated by a human and if the word &#8220;neighbour&#8221; is interpreted in its literal sense. With the operation of the explanatory element and always assuming correspondence to a state of affairs, two propositions are implied beyond &#8220;**_P2_** _is true_&#8220;: (i) &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn is** **human**_&#8221; and (ii) &#8220;_**It is true that Joselyn is my neighbour**_&#8220;.

Yet there is a possibility, even a remote one, that the term &#8220;neighbour&#8221; in **P2** is used metaphorically or in some other idiosyncratic sense. Whether that is indeed the case or not is not pertinent to the current example. What is our intention is to rather admit the possibility of things being different and, most importantly, to adapt to that scenario by incorporating a dialectical restraint in our logical analysis of the phrase. The ramifications on the implicit propositions of **P2** would then be two-fold: (a) &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn is human** is sometimes true_&#8221; and (b) &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn is my neighbour** is sometimes true_&#8220;. A reformulation of &#8220;_**P2 **is sometimes true_&#8221; would then stand for &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn is human **and **it is true that Jocelyn is my neighbour** and **it is true that Jocelyn has curly hair **is sometimes true_&#8220;.

**P2** is thus to be considered a more descriptive and specific phrase than **P1**, for it provides more solid grounds for holding justified opinions on the implicit propositions therein. However, it still leaves a relatively broad scope of interpretation in the definition of &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221;, for even though it is communicated that they are the neighbour of the one presenting **P2** it is not clear whether this status is one of exclusivity or not. It might be the case that there are several entities who can qualify for the description contained in **P2**, suggesting a need to maintain an aporetic approach in our examination of it.

Proceeding to **P3** two additional descriptive elements are introduced, namely &#8220;my colleague&#8221; and &#8220;_next door_ neighbour&#8221;. These two statements, when functioning in tandem, contribute to the further specification of the entity &#8220;Joselyn&#8221;. They allow us to exclude all possible candidates for &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; that do not partake of _all_ the particularities entailed in **P3**. They do, in other words, provide certain conditions for exclusivity that can be used as benchmarks with which to assess and ultimately draw clear delineations between valid and invalid cases applicable to **P3**. It thus becomes more likely, if not certain that &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; is a human, that this very &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221; is the colleague of the one stating **P3** and that they do stay in the next-door residence from the subject. Consequently, and assuming correspondence of **P3** to a state of affairs, we have:

  * &#8220;**_P3_** _is true_&#8220;
  * &#8220;_**It is true that Jocelyn, my next door neighbour and colleague, has curly hair** is true_&#8220;
  * &#8220;**_It is true that Jocelyn is human_**_ and_**_ it is true that Jocelyn is my next door neighbour_**_ and **it is true that Jocelyn is my colleague **and **it is true that Jocelyn has curly hair **is true_&#8220;
  * &#8220;**_It is true that Jocelyn is human_**_ and_**_ it is true that Jocelyn is my next door neighbour_**_ and _**it is true that Jocelyn is my colleague **and_ **it is true that Jocelyn has curly hair** and **it is true that all this is germane to Jocelyn **is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sometimes</span> true_&#8220;

The last formulation of **P3** suggests that while there may be very good reasons to justify assumptions on the uniqueness/exclusivity of &#8220;Jocelyn&#8221;, they will still not reveal any universal, necessary and sufficient conditions for truth; a truth that holds in all possible states of affairs. The additional factors of specification peculiar to **P3** which were not found in **P1** or **P2**, do foster a degree of certainty that facilitates daily communication or context-specific statements underpinned by knowledge of the same status, though they do not provide the kind of precision and clarity necessary for grasping the abstract, transcendental structure of reality.

All phrases here examined, **P1**, **P2**, **P3**, differ in their descriptiveness and specificity, ranging from more vague/accurate to less vague/accurate. Their commonality consists in their epistemic value, where they all convey knowledge _about_ a certain state of affairs, inasmuch as they are indeed corresponding to it — _inasmuch as they are true _that is. Should they be true, they would be describing an instance of reality, which implies that our understanding of them would furnish an understanding of that specific case. To that end, description and specification can engender an awareness of the factors that interoperate to deliver such an outcome, and, furthermore, they can contribute to clarifying the concepts drawn out of them, while also potentially improving the precision of any statement to be issued thenceforth.

In logical analysis, we find that it is a matter of studious scrutiny to identify the descriptiveness and specificity of propositions in order to gauge their accuracy in documenting states of affairs. By doing so, we reduce or eliminate the factors that contribute to the obscurity of the subject matter, permitting us to proceed from its indirect description to its direct comprehension — from our knowledge _about_ it to our knowledge _of_ it. For epistemology and metaphysics, this means to appreciate the epistemic value entailed in each proposition and the relation it has to the eternal aspects of reality.
