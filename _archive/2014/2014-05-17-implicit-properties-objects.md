The present article shall be treated as a continuation of the analysis that took place in two recent posts: (i) [_Discernment and classification of objects_](https://protesilaos.com/discernment-classification-objects/ "Discernment and classification of objects"), (ii) [_Descriptive and synthetic arrays_](https://protesilaos.com/descriptive-synthetic-arrays/ "Descriptive and synthetic arrays"). The reader who is acquainted with their content will find it easier to appreciate the themes here considered.

In classifying objects, properties are specified that engender discernibility. If object **O** features property **a** and if object **Q** has property **b**, where _a ≠ b_ and where these properties are constitutive of their respective objects, and should no other information be considered, then _O ≠ Q_. Examined as such, this information describes a certain state of affairs. The knowledge derived therefrom is commensurate with the degree of correspondence the information has to the state of affairs it refers to; it is correlated to the truthfulness of the information.

When the exercise of classification increases in scale, arrays of objects are formed, which serve the purpose of revealing the_ structure_ peculiar to these objects. The array **Fruit(Apple, Banana, Grape)**,** **to the extent that it is truthful, conveys the following quantum of knowledge:

  1. Object &#8220;Fruit&#8221; is a higher level abstraction than &#8220;Apple&#8221;, &#8220;Banana&#8221;, &#8220;Grape&#8221; (its extensions);
  2. The extensions stand at the same order of abstraction;
  3. The properties constitutive of &#8220;Fruit&#8221; are to be found in its extensions, though not vice-versa;
  4. The extensions are related to one another by virtue of all partaking of their abstraction &#8220;Fruit&#8221; and the properties thereof;
  5. The properties of the abstraction will be numerically less than those of its extensions, since the abstraction encapsulates what is _common in the multitude_, rather than encompassing _all that is specific_;
  6. The extensions of &#8220;Fruit&#8221; cannot be part of what negates it, though they do belong to whatever higher-order abstraction &#8220;Fruit&#8221; may be an extension of.

An array that is _descriptive_ will document the properties germane to each object, so that a group of data can be formed, such as:

  * <span style="color: #444444;">Fruit(plant, edible)</span>
  * <span style="color: #444444;">Apple(green, bitter)</span>
  * Banana(yellow, starchy)
  * Grape(red, sweet)

The _synthetic _array encompassing all this data would therefore be <span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Fruit(plant, edible)[Apple(green, bitter), Banana(yellow, starchy), Grape(red, sweet)]</strong>. If truthful, it would engender an awareness as to what are the objects under consideration and in what ways do they differ <em>qua</em> objects with properties.</span>

## Discernibility by association

There are however cases where an array need not be enumerative to foster discernibility; where properties can be inferred from _linguistic_, _conventional_ and _situational_ parameters. Let us elaborate on an imaginary case:

A. If this Article **A** where to be described in the database of this website, it would among others be classified under the content type to which it belongs: **Post**. Furthermore, it would be grouped in accordance with the taxonomies peculiar to **Post**, such as &#8220;category&#8221; and &#8220;tag&#8221;. A synthetic array of such sort could therefore be **Post[A(philosophy, logic)]**. Assuming acquaintance with the applied methodology, a human (or machine) parsing this data will know that **A** is an object that partakes of the content type **Post**, is categorised as **philosophy **and has the tag **logic**.

B. Along these lines, another type of content featured on this website&#8217;s database could be **Book**. There may be an instance where an object belonging to book, such as the Book **B**, could also fall under the taxonomies specific to **Book**, such as the category **philosophy** and the tag **logic**. Hence, the synthetic array would be **Book[B(philosophy, logic)]**. Again, whomsoever is familiar with the manner in which such information is formatted, will know that **B** is an object that partakes of **Book**, is filed under the category **philosophy** and bears the tag **logic**.

C. In comparing this latter array with the former, we are presented with two sets of data that describe objects whose properties appear to be _identical_, which renders their differentiation seemingly meaningless. The data does not tell us explicitly how it is that one object is discernible from the other, apart from the fact that their label (name) is different. Labels may not be sufficient to draw delineations between classes. A second article **A2** also under the category **philosophy** and the tag **logic** would still be an extension of **Post**. Same for any additional object under the content type **Book**. What is therefore at stake, is to appreciate the _factors of implied discernment_ germane to **Post** and **Book**.

## Factors of implied discernment

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The linguistic:</span>** In common language we already attach properties to concepts/objects named by words, so that any agent who knows the meaning of the words can understand the differences in their significations. One can tell that a blog _post_ on philosophy and logic _is not_ the same as a _book_ on philosophy and logic, by virtue of attaching distinct meanings to the terms &#8220;post&#8221; and &#8220;book&#8221;. In terms of the scenario here discussed, the choice to distinguish between two types of content may therefore be predicated on the willingness to make linguistic familiarity a contributor to the website&#8217;s functionality.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The conventional:</span>** On the same scenario, consider that one website database is merely drawing delineations between types of content for the sake of specialising their presentation. All that belongs to **Post** could feature a section for user comments, while all that shares in **Book** could have a shopping cart functionality. These different functions, if exclusive to each one, would make the two content types distinct from one another. The implication is that properties of such objects, even when they have the _same_ label, are in fact distinct by virtue of being treated _as properties_, not objects. So e.g. the **philosophy** category for **Post** _can be_ one kind of taxonomy and the **philosophy** category for **Book** _can be_ another if such a choice is made.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The situational:</span>** An implied property can also be identified in an object that exists in a given way within a certain situation. If **Post** and **Book** are to be parts of the [protesilaos.com](https://protesilaos.com/ "Protesilaos Stavrou") website, then not only are they content types, having the imaginary properties mentioned above, but they mostly are such _inasmuch_ as they _also_ are characterised by their presence on that website. Their relation to the broader website itself bestows on them their very status while, furthermore, it is indicative of the fact that they _can_ inherit the properties germane to the website.

Whether these implied properties are actual or perceived, is secondary to the _possibility _of them being inferred. Implicit properties might not be germane to the objects they are attached to. They may not be _necessary _and _sufficient_ elements that are constitutive of the very nature of the object in question.

However, objects that are not treated _in nothing_ but rather in the constitution of the case where they are made manifest, can be inextricably bound up together with their implicit properties, whether these are linguistic, conventional or situational. Perhaps then, any exercise of classification must, at the very least, specify the constitution of the case it is describing, and be prepared to provide arguments as to the reason(s) certain orders of abstraction are stipulated.

The point remains: the classification of information — which is the classification of knowledge where the information is true in describing states of affairs — can deliver precision of statement when it rests on clarity of concept, ultimately fostering greater certainty.
