I am developing two new themes for my minimalistic `doric-themes`
package for Emacs. These combine gold with teal hues. `doric-beach` is
the light theme and `doric-valley` is its dark counterpart. Here are
the screenshots:

## Coming in version 0.4.0

The character of the themes is well-defined, though I may still make some small tweaks. Expect these and other improvements to be available in the next stable version of the `doric-themes`, which I expect to publish some time before the end of August.

## About the Doric themes

The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.
