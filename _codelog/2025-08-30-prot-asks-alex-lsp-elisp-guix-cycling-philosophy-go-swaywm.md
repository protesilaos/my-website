In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:
<https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/>.

In this video I talk with Alex about a range of interesting topics. We
start with the topic of working with programming languages as a hobby:
to learn about them and to write projects in them. In this context, we
discuss Alex's attempt to write a language server (LSP) for Python in
Zig. We also explore the experience of developing packages in Emacs
Lisp. Still on the technical side of things, I ask Alex about the Guix
system and what are the reasons for or against using it. After that, I
ask Alex about other hobbies, to learn about the interest in cycling
and the idea of travelling around Europe on a bicycle. Next, we
exchange thoughts on Alex's learning of philosophy and discuss some of
the basics of it. Towards the final part of our discussion, I ask
about the Go game, which I have never played. I learn a lot in the
process, while commenting on what I like more in tabletop games.
Finally, Alex tells me about using the Sway tiling window manager and
how positive the experience has been thus.

Here are Alex's Git repositories: <https://codeberg.org/alex-iam>.
