title: "Emacs: my new Doric themes"
excerpt: "Minimalist themes for GNU Emacs to complement my ef-themes (maximalist) and modus-themes (moderate)."
---

The `doric-themes` is my new in-development package for Emacs. It is a set of themes that conform with a minimalist aesthetic: they use few colours and appear monochromatic in many contexts. Below are the screen shots.

In terms of my overall theme work for Emacs, the `doric-themes` are the most minimalist, `ef-themes` the most maximalist, and the `modus-themes` remain what I consider the best "default theme" style. All of them are designed to be highly legible.

I plan to add `doric-themes` to GNU ELPA within the next days. For the time being, they are only available from source code: <https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes>.

Finally, the backronym for "Doric" is "Doric Only Really Intensifies Conservatively".

Enjoy your new theme!
