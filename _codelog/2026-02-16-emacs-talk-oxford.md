People from the University of Oxford are organising events related to
free software: [FLOSS @ Oxford](https://ox.ogeer.org/).

On Thursday, the 12th of March 2026, at 6 PM United Kingdom time (GMT)
I will give a talk titled [Computing in freedom with GNU Emacs](https://ox.ogeer.org/event/computing-in-freedom-with-gnu-emacs-protesilaos-stavrou).
My intention is to introduce Emacs to a wide audience. Participation
is open to everyone.

I will post a reminder as we get closer to the date of the event.
Looking forward to it!
