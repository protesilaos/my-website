title: "Emacs: new 'oak' and 'pine' doric-themes"
excerpt: "These are two new themes for my minimalist doric-themes package for Emacs."

I am working on two new themes for my minimalist `doric-themes`
collection. Both explore the woody, earthly, chthonic motif. Here they
are:

<a href="{{'/assets/images/doric/doric-oak.png' | absolute_url }}"><img alt="doric-oak theme sample" src="{{'/assets/images/doric/doric-oak.png' | absolute_url }}"/></a>

<a href="{{'/assets/images/doric/doric-pine.png' | absolute_url}}"><img alt="doric-pine theme sample" src="{{'/assets/images/doric/doric-pine.png' | absolute_url }}"/></a>

I may still make further refinements, though the character of the
themes is set. Once I am done, I will publish them as part of version
`0.3.0` of the package.

## About the Doric themes

The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.
