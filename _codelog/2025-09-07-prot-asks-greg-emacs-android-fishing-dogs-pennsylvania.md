In this video, I talk to Greg about a number of topics ranging from
the technical work one does in Emacs to outdoors activities in
Pennsylvania. Our discussion starts with the topic of Emacs, where I
learn that Greg has been working professionally with software for
twenty years. In Greg's experience, one of the advantages of using
Emacs for work is that you do not need to change your tools when you
switch jobs or work with different programming languages. We then
discuss Greg's attempt to use Emacs on Android, as there now is an
official build for that platform. We briefly touch on the Clojure
programming language and also talk about ways of learning to program.
Once we cover these technical issues, we switch to the outdoor
activities that Greg enjoys: cycling, fishing, and just being outside
with his dog. I learn from Greg a few things about fishing and we
eventually comment on a lot of more profound insights about natural
experiences in general. Our final comments revolve around the
appreciation of the comments, in light of a politics essay I published
recently titled "When your country is a theme park":
