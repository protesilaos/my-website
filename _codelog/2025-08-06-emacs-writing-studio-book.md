title: "I got the Emacs Writing Studio (EWS) book"
excerpt: "I have the Emacs Writing Studio paperback version of the book. It is nice and shows that we can use Emacs for publishing."

The _Emacs Writing Studio_ (EWS) by Peter Prevos is a configuration
for Emacs designed for writers, researchers, and scientists. It
provides an integrated environment to express one's thoughts and
publish them in multiple formats. The book, which is produced using
EWS, documents the setup, describes relevant methods or workflows, and
explains how everything is pieced together. I contributed the foreword.

This morning, I got the paperback version of the book. It is a thing
of beauty!

Thanks to Peter for working on this and for showing how Emacs can also
be used as a professional publishing tool.
