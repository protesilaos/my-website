In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:
https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/.

Today I learn from Eric about using Emacs in a constrained environment
for programming. We cover Eric's work, which is security-minded,
discuss the qualities of Lisp, and explore how aesthetics relate to
programming. Our discussion shifts to Eric's music production and
interests, where we find how, among others, matters of art apply to
everyday affairs as well. In the final part of our chat, Eric tells me
about Minnesota's connection to the water element, compare it to the
relationship Greeks have with the sea, and comment on relevant
artistic expressions such as the meaning of the God Poseidon's
representation as a hypermasculine man.
