title: "Join me for 'Prot Asks' public video calls about Emacs and life in general"
excerpt: "Let's do video chats in a casual way and things we have in common."
---

I want to start a video series where I talk one-on-one with a person about Emacs, technology in general, and whatever life issues. The idea is to connect via Jitsi, Jami, Signal, or something similar, and I will take care to record the conversation. I will then host the video on my YouTube channel and publicise it on my website. The video will not be edited unless you think it is necessary.

The format should be casual: a ~1-hour chat where we start with things that interest us and then go with the flow of the conversation. There will be jokes or lighthearted moments and we can run off on tangential points. No problem; no stress! I will be posing questions that are general and friendly in nature to keep the discussion going. What the questions are will depend on the topic we are covering. This should not be an interview or debate: just an exchange between Internet folks who have things in common.

You do not need to have a strong presence online to qualify. I am willing to talk to anyone. Of course, if you do have public pages, you are welcome to promote them in the chat and I will provide the relevant links in the description of the video.

Are you interested to talk with me? All I ask of you is that (i) you agree to show your face on camera and (ii) agree that I publish the video on my YouTube channel and website.

Contact me and we will sort out the meeting details: <https://protesilaos.com/contact>. Also let me know if you have any further questions.

We can do this!
