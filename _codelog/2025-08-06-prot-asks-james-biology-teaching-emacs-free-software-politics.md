In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:
https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/.

In this 1-hour video, I learn from James about what goes into teaching
biology and thinking as a scientist. We discuss the shortcomings of
the education system and touch on the alternative approach of going
more in-depth. James describes how Emacs comes into the picture, the
importance of the free software community---and community in
general---and how politics informs our views on competition and
cooperation.
