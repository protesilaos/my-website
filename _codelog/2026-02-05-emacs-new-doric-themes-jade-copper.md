title: "Emacs: new Doric themes 'doric-jade' and 'doric-copper'"
excerpt: "I am developing two new themes for my minimalistic 'doric-themes' package for Emacs."
---

I have added two new themes to my minimalist `doric-themes` package.
The collection is growing to cover styles that range from austere to
playful.

`doric-jade` is a light theme with an emphais on green. `doric-copper`
is a dark theme with mostly orange accents and hints of patina. Both
themes retain the Doric quality of using few colours while relying on
typography to establish rhythm and structure.

Below are their samples.

## Coming in `doric-themes` version 0.7.0

Both `doric-jade` and `doric-copper` are in-development. I have
already worked on their finer point, but may still make some tweaks
before publishing them as part of the next stable version of the
`doric-themes`.

## About the Doric themes

The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm. Legibility is still high.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.
