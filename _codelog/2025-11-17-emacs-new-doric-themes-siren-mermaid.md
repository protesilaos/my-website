I am developing two new themes for my minimalistic `doric-themes`
package for Emacs. These combine marine hues with some warmer accents,
cast on a fairly prominent backdrop. `doric-siren` is a light theme,
while `doric-mermaid` is dark. Below are some screenshots to give you
an idea of what to expect.

## Coming in `doric-themes` version 0.5.0

The character of the themes is established and, in principle, I will
not change them further. Though I am giving it a few more days of
further testing to confirm I did not miss something. Expect these and
other improvements to be available in the next stable version of the
`doric-themes`, which I expect to publish before the end of November.

## About the Doric themes

The Doric themes use few colours and will appear monochromatic in many
contexts. They are my most minimalist themes. Styles involve the
careful use of typographic features and subtleties in colour gradients
to establish a consistent rhythm. Legibility is still high.

If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my `ef-themes`
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
"default theme" for a text editor, opt for my `modus-themes`.
