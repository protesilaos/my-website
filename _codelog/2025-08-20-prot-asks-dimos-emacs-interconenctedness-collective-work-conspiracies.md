In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:
<https://protesilaos.com/prot-asks/>.

In this video, I talk with Dimos from Greece about Emacs as an
integrated computing environment. I learn how Dimos started using
Emacs 10 years ago while studying mathematics: what is the appeal of
Lisp and how that opened the way for using Emacs as an integrated
computing environment. We also discuss the work Dimos does, which is
part of a technology collective called "Stin Priza" that provides a
variety of web services. In this context we explore themes of
ownership and of belonging to a community or a place. I then ask about
personal interests and other activities, to learn about some of the
naturalist activities Dimos does as well as the podcast that Dimos
co-hosts called "The Conspiracy Club": it is a show that has been
going on for five years now, which discusses conspiracy theories and
other mysteries with an open mind and a playful attitude, neither
adopting the theories nor debunking them.
