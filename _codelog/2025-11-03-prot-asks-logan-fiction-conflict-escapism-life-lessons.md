In this +2-hour video, I talk to Logan about story-telling, finding
conflict and escapism in fiction, and related life lessons.

We start with a brief introduction to what Logan is doing right now.
He is a university student in the field of general science. His
interest is in game development, though he has not pursued that as a
specialisation yet. Logan is also into writing fiction, which he tells
me more about through our conversation.

I ask Logan what does conflict mean in the case of story-telling. How
are we drawn into the story and what can we learn from it. We discuss
how sometimes the story becomes self-fulfilling and how people can be
influenced to act accordingly.

Part of our talk involves thought experiments and explores
philosophical themes. We make comments on the fact that material
conditions do not necessarily lend themselves to a single appropriate
action.

In the context of stories as a means of understanding current
dynamics, we discuss how we can envisage possible worlds before they
occur and regulate our behaviour in response to what we think is right
or wrong about the manner of our ways.

Towards the end of our exchange, Logan tells me about the work of
fiction he is writing. He will eventually publish it and I am excited
to learn more about it.
