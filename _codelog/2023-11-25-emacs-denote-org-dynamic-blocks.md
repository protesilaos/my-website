In this video I demonstrate Denote's Org dynamic blocks facility. I
focus on the new 'denote-files' Org dynamic block that I am
developing. In short, this new block lets you include the contents of
files with the option to also add links to them as well as to omit
their front matter from the block. It is a neat way to quickly
consolidate your writings on a given topic.
