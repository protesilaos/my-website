The `ef-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for GNU
Emacs that provide colourful ("pretty") yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the `modus-themes` (also
designed by me).

## Version 2.1.0 on 2026-01-27

This version introduces two carefully designed, legible and colourful
themes: `ef-orange` (light) and `ef-fig` (dark). Both draw inspiration
from the fruits they are name after.

The convenience commands `ef-themes-select-dark` and
`ef-themes-select-light` use the minibuffer to select+load an Ef theme
that is either dark or light, respectively. The more general command
is `ef-themes-select`.

All screen shots of the themes are updated to reflect their current
status: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

Remember that since version `2.0.0`, the `ef-themes` are built on top
of my `modus-themes`. This means that most of the changes happen to
Modus and are inherited by Ef.
