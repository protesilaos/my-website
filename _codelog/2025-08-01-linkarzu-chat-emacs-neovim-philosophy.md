I had a ~2-hour-and-30-minute discussion with Christian from the
@linkarzu YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@linkarzu>.

We talked about Emacs, the underlying idea of an integrated computing
environment, how NeoVim effectively took the source of Vim and infused
with the spirit of Emacs, thinking in terms of extensibility and
cohesion, why purists cannot impose an arbitrary limit to
extensibility, and more.

We also discuss other interesting topics, such as Debian and Arch
Linux, how free software emphasises freedom, why it is okay to earn an
income while contributing to free software, custom keyboards and
ergonomics, my journey into computing, alcohol and substance abuse,
and other issues of everyday life.

Thanks to Christian for inviting me to this chat! I had a good time
and wish all the best with the @linkarzu channel!
