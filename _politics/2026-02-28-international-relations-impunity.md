The war of the United States of America and Israel against Iran is yet
another case of power that runs unchecked within its sphere of
influence. America has the privilege to operate with impunity in many
parts of the world because there is no authority that will impose
penalties. What unfolded in Venezuela foreshadows what will happen to
Cuba and maybe even to Greenland and Iceland. One by one, the weakest
links in the chain are being dismantled without anyone doing anything
to stop it. Russia is pinned in Ukraine, while China cannot project
strength away from home.

The inherent limitation of a rules-based international order is that
there is no sovereign. Without a supreme authority that has the
capacity to enforce the law, all norms remain inapplicable and are
effectively non-binding. Any sufficiently capable regime can brazenly
disregard them, violate the national sovereignty of other states, and
grab any resources it deems worthwhile. The sole deterrent is the
military might of its adversaries. By extension, rules are enforced
when the balance of forces permits as much.

The United Nations architecture gives the impression that there is
ironclad supranational law that guides all humanity. While this is the
stated aim, any UN-led initiative that gets to be applied is so
because it is aligned with the interests of great powers.

The Palestinian catastrophe demonstrates that the so-called
"international community" is a figment of the imagination at worst, or
a happy coincidence at best. The law is not designed to protect the
weak no matter the circumstances. It all depends on power dynamics,
where expedience is the deciding factor.

Israel has been gradually yet steadily assuming the same privilege of
unaccountability in its ambition to become the region's uncontested
despot. There is no reason to believe that toppling the Iranian
government will make the Israeli military any less assertive. If
anything, a potential win in the war against Iran will galvanise those
who aspire for a greater Israel that dominates the Eastern
Mediterranean and the Middle East. Those on the sidelines have gotten
the memo. Strategists in Turkiye, for instance, must be analysing
events in light of the clear potential for a time of reckoning in the
decades ahead.

The gist is that justice only exists among equals. For as long as the
mighty do not think of themselves as being on the same footing as the
rest they will exploit their advantageous position. This is true in
the relations between states. It also is in effect at the
interpersonal level: you only deter a bully by making the cost of
bullying prohibitive, not by appealing to their sense of morality.
Calls to justice are, in this regard, an admission of weakness.

Is this a pretty world? No, it is ugly and dangerous. Though it is
sobering to recognise how things work. For only then can you cut
through the platitudes and prepare for action.

Europeans, in particular, have long lived with a boutique view of
politics, in which soft power can be decoupled from hard power. Hence
their belief in the vaunted "European values". In truth, soft power is
effective when it has hard power as its backstop: they exist on a
continuum. Europeans had that in the form of their vassalage to the
USA. They might eventually develop their own capacity in the decades
to come, if the European integration process continues apace towards
military union, while the Americans get progressively weaker by all
the wars they inevitably involve themselves in. At any rate, such an
outcome will only contribute to peace by balancing out competing
interests, not by holding some imaginary moral high ground.

There are no benevolent actors in such matters. Those who desire
freedom must be ready to fight for it. Global justice is not
attainable. What we can hope for is a viable balance of forces.

As for the ongoing war, the Iranian regime has blood on its hands, as
do its counterparts in Israel and America.
