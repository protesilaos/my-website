I received an insightful comment on my video presentation about [the
nation-state, democracy, and
transnationalism](https://protesilaos.com/politics/2021-05-29-nation-state-democracy-transnationalism/)
(2021-05-29), which inspired me to elaborate on my rationale for some of
the issues raised therein.  The comment's author preferred to remain
anonymous.  The text of the exchange is reproduced verbatim and is

Thank you!  Yes, I will try to keep them short going forward.  1-hour
long presentations are a bit tiring (and I record them in one go as with
all my videos, which makes them difficult for me as well).

Before we proceed: may I publish this exchange on my website?  I will
simply quote what is available here and just link to the video's post.
A brief introductory note will describe the context.  If you want, I can
write your name as it appears here, or you can give me the expanded
version.  Here is an example of a recent case where the author wanted to

I think it is important we disaggregate the issues here.  One is the
problématique of people's interest in the commons.  The other is
basically a division of labour.

With regard to the former, we need to account for the scale of
operations.  If you ask a Cypriot farmer in the mountains what is their
opinion on the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, they will likely have
none whatsoever, or none that is informed and useful.  An observer of
this phenomenon could attribute this to indifference, where the farmer
simply does not care about politics and just blithely accepts policy
programmes that have a profound effect on their daily life qua farmer
without questioning them.  The same observer could alternatively surmise
that the apparent indifference is nothing but the result---the
epiphenomenon---of powerlessness, as the Common Agricultural Policy is a
grand bargain between EU Member States (within the context of the
Multi-annual Financial Framework) where not even all Cypriot farmers
united on a single platform will ever have any meaningful effect on.

As for the division of labour, there are indeed lots of complex issues
where specialisation is required.  Complexity is not only because of the
issues themselves.  At least a part of it is due to structural
constraints.  Think, for example, about the EU architecture and how much
knowledge it takes to figure out who does what, for which cases, and to
what extent.  Then extend that to the complexity inside individual
countries (and Cyprus, despite the multifaceted challenges of the
Cypriot dispute, the Treaty of Guarantee and Treaty of Alliance, is a
"fairly straightforward" unitary state as of this writing).  An observer
could argue that this highly stratified system of decision-making is a
necessary outcome of the magnitude of phenomena we are confronted with.
While another interpretation could be that the complexity of some events
is compounded by the intricate hierarchical structures that concentrate
power in some centres, depending on the scope of the policy in question.

What I am suggesting is that there is room for interpretation and the
established order conditions our way of thinking about it and the world
at-large.

Coming back to the joint themes of indifference and complexity, let us
take them at face value.  Let us posit that, by and large, people do not
care and that, in general, people cannot make an impact anyway because
of how difficult those issues are.  If we accept those points, then why
should our world insist that it is democratic or, rather, insist on the
pretence that it is democratic, as I argue in the video?  If people are
indifferent and/or ignorant, then what are the representatives actually
representing?  And here we should clarify that representation is across
the board, not particular to one policy (e.g. all farmers having a
common voice in the form of a delegate).  To the effect that such
representation is exposed both to indifference and complexity.  Again,
if those are inescapable or immanent, what is being represented?
"Nothing meaningful", I would add.

Hence my claim that the legitimation function that is performed with the
existing means is inadequate, to say the least.

> (2) Governments are not elected because of their specific policies,

Sometimes this is true.  Other times it is a matter of the personality
that assumes the leadership role.  What is the ideology of the grand
coalitions of Germany?  What is the ideology of Mario Draghi in Italy
who is supposed to be there in a 'technical' capacity?

Regardless, we still have the fundamental problem of representation.  If
the means by which the present order is legitimised are not sufficient
(per the previous point), then we cannot be certain that a clearly
delineated ideology is being prioritised or preferred.

Now consider the point of governments being elected on matters of
ideology rather than policy.  Why does every party make programmatic
commitments, promising all sorts of legislative initiatives?  Suppose
though that those are irrelevant and the substantive aspect of policy
does not matter in the formation of governments.  Is that not another
indication that we have a non-representative group of delegates in
charge of affairs?  To continue with the example of the farmers, if
their specific demands for sustenance on their land are not met by the
government they voted for, then that government does not represent them
for those particular issues.  Which links to complexity or, more
specifically, to the invocation of the general will of the people,
national interest, etc.  Basically, it is said that the government
represents the people at-large, which is a dubious claim (not to repeat
what I cover in the video).

Biased yes.  To be impartial is very hard.  More so in political affairs
(and I do not purport to be unopinionated here).  Which is why we should
be careful with those who appeal to impartiality (e.g. Mario Draghi).

For selfishness, it depends on what we are talking about.  Don't
families (at least some of them) have solidarity between their members?
Do they not help each other out?  Have you ever given money to a friend
without asking it back, or have known of such cases?  Have you ever done
work without asking for remuneration, such as to help paint the
neighbour's house or train their dog?

Selfishness is part of human nature.  Though it is ameliorated by social
relations where the altruistic spirit is made manifest.  Perhaps then,
what really matters is the structure of incentives that apply to each
case and how that conditions people into behaving individualistically or
collectively.  Here, too, we have a case where the established order may
be conditioning our thinking about it and the world in general.

To the point about success or failure in the market, I think we already
have those mechanisms in place for small-scale businesses (as noted in
the video).  Where things stop being about a level-playing field is as
we move upwards in the hierarchy, where we find variations of the excuse
that certain entities are "too big to fail" (or are pillars of the
national economy, integral to the national interest, etc.).  Bail-out
programmes shift taxpayer money into the coffers of privately-held
entities, to the effect that they socialise private loses.  In Cyprus,
"we the people" paid for the mismanagement of Marfin Laiki Bank and for
the incompetence of the Central Bank that channelled billions of
Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) into an insolvent corporation.  The
people were not asked about how their tax money should be used (again,
non-representation) and they never got a share of the spoils, so to
speak.  When public money is used to pamper or rescue private gains,
there is something fundamentally wrong.

Speaking of the ELA, this relates to what central banks are currently
doing (and have been doing).  No citizen ever elected a central banker
or ever approved of any of those policies.  Not even if we take the
present means of legitimation as sufficient for the task (e.g. in the EU
(and elsewhere) parliaments do not vote on the specifics of central bank
policy, due to the institutional independence of the latter).

Yes, the pandemic has shown that we need experts.  We need specialists
for practically everything in life.  Though it is important we
disambiguate expertise from technocracy in the literal sense of "rule by
the experts".

Let us put the pandemic aside as it is an ongoing issue which might
still change how we think about it, and consider the previous crisis
where governments appealed to expertise to fix the economy (or so the
claim was).  Those experts, economists in their training, were in
agreement about reforms that would benefit creditors, such as in the
form of bail-outs and then on the handling of non-performing loans.

The government which appointed those economists, was not impartial to
begin with: governments being ideological, as you suggested, but also in
practical terms because it had already picked sides by bailing out those
"too big to fail" creditors (practically "too big to jail"), thus
putting them in a strong negotiating position vis-à-vis those smaller
entities who had taken on loans.  Then the experts effectively confirmed
what was a fait accompli: to continue to favour the creditors.

For the pandemic, I think we need to wait and see.  One obvious
constraint in terms of the management of the phenomena is that the years
of austerity leading up to present day had rendered health services
ineffective, underfunded, understaffed, and severely lacking in
equipment.

This experience reminds us of the structural and/or intergenerational
aspect of politics, where previous decisions determine the boundaries of
the present horizon of possibilities.  Those previous decisions were, in
the immediate sense, about the 2008+ economic crisis, in which experts
were not objective, strictly speaking (then we can ask how we were led
to an economic order where exposure to financial risk was not properly
accounted for, and so on).

In short, expertise is good to have and we should always take it into
account, but we still have a lot of things to consider.  The excuse that
leads down the slippery slope of technocracy is that the experts are
impartial and that their decisions should remain uncontested.

It puts things in perspective.

This relates to your first point about indifference and complexity.  I
left it last because that is how it appeared in your comment, but also
because I want to tackle it on its own.

First off, I am not in favour of referenda over issues that cannot be
answered with a simple Yes or No.  The Annan Plan was such a case.  The
reason is that you are presented with a block vote, a choice of all or
nothing.  Does the "No" vote mean that citizens were against (i) a
resolution per se, (ii) a resolution in the form of a federal system in
general, (iii) a resolution in the form of the particular federal
system, (iv) individual provisions of the plan, (v) other considerations
and what would those be?  We do not know from the result of the
referendum itself.  The vote is not reflective of opinions and, thus,
non-representative.

Just to bring up the Brexit vote for a moment, Theresa May famously
stated that "Brexit means Brexit".  That kind of meaningless statement
shows us exactly how obscure the result of a referendum can be.

The internal complexity of the Annan Plan is not a justification for
making the process of both its formation and eventual approval
non-representative.  For example, and without asking to reform the
entire decision-making edifice, we could expect a new plan to be
presented to parliamentarians with each provision being open to
amendments/deliberation.  Those drafts would then be brought together
and reconsidered in light of the resulting consolidated text, and then
taken back to parliamentarians for approval.  Only afterwards would they
put the proposal to a popular vote.  The original draft and all the
amendments would be available online, while the whole procedure would be
live streamed and recorded for on-demand access by anyone.  This is a
more involved process for sure, but that is what popular participation
entails.  If we (not me and you, the general "we") do not want all this
seemingly inefficient back-and-forth, then why do we insist on having
democracy or, as I noted earlier, why do we cling on to the appearance
of democratic legitimacy?

Agreed!  I cannot claim with confidence that giving people power or
greater responsibility would necessarily make them care more, become
competent, and the like.  There would probably need to be complementary
measures that would have to be adopted to essentially re-train people as
citizens, but trying to enumerate them here or fathom their modalities
is beside the point.  We cannot know for sure unless we try or start
thinking about trying.  And even once we have had committed to a new
course of action, our experience would not be immediately reproducible
in other historical-cultural contexts.  Life is messy and we tend to
learn through trial and error, including when we try to be prescient and
reasonable.
