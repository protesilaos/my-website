The region of Cyprus where I live was engulfed by wildfires. They
affected many villages, leading to the loss of life and property. At
their peak, the fires were ~300 metres away from my hut. I temporarily
abandoned my place together with my dogs and a backpack with all the
essentials. I was well prepared to deal with the challenge. I cover
this in more depth in the video and also show some clips of the
phenomena. Anyway, all went well and the situation is now under
control. I am returning to my normal life.
