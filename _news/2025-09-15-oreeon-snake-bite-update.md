A status update on what happened last week when one of my puppies,
Oreeon, got bitten by a venomous snake. I had to take him to the
veterinary clinic where he had to spend the night. The morning after,
I called the doctor to check on my dog. The doctor insisted that
Oreeon stays at the clinic for at least another day because he had not
eaten yet. He also told me not to bother with a visit, as it would not
change things: the puppy had to remain at the clinic. This is the
story of what I did instead of complying with the doctor's demands and
how I brought Oreeon back home with me.
