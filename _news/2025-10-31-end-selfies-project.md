title: "End of the selfies project"
excerpt: "What I learnt from this experiment and why I conclude it earlier than scheduled."
---

In mid-September I launched my "selfies project". Here is the
dedicated section of my website: <https://protesilaos.com/selfies>.
The idea of this project was to take a selfie each day and post it on
my website. Why? Because I realised that I had no pictures of people
in my camera roll, so I thought I might be doing something wrong.
Starting with taking photos of me seemed like the obvious first step
towards changing the status quo.

I had originally committed to run the series until the end of the
year. Here is the article with the announcement of the project and the
first selfie embedded therein: <https://protesilaos.com/news/2025-09-15-selfie-project/>.

I knew that the cumulative file size could be an issue, but I had not
actually checked how big the `jpg` files are. It turns out they are
large. To not make my website any heavier than it needs to be and to
minimise longer-term constraints with hosting arrangements, I am
hereby concluding the selfies project.

It was a fun experiment. I might still post the occasional photo,
revealing or not, but not daily anymore (yes, I did censor a few).

What I learnt about myself:

1. I kept the streak, despite the abrupt ending. I am good at doing
   what I set my mind to, but it was still a challenge to make this
   happen, given that I had to force myself to get used to the whole
   selfie thing.
2. I still do not care about pictures of people. Not me, not others.
   And this is despite the fact I had several chances to take such
   shots. Whereas I enjoy capturing moments of my dogs, eagles flying
   above me, crows looking into my room, foxes in close proximity (I
   even have a video where I walk close behind a fox without it
   noticing me for a while), hedgehogs running around, picturesque
   mountainscapes throughout the year, flowers of all sorts, and
   generally all the beauty around me. Not the human element though:
   it remains distant.
3. Originally the selfies were visible from my website's home page as
   well as the catch-all RSS/Atom feed. I removed them after a few
   days on the premise that they would crowd out my other
   publications. I think this is factually true, but I will not rule
   out the possibility that it was also a convenient excuse to
   relegate the selfies to obscurity where really only I would see
   them.
4. Fact or rationalisation, I think what matters is that I still
   prefer to be known for my deeds. I have so much to do on the
   creative front: essays, poems, and videos. I wish to be useful
   to---and even connect with---like-minded people. Pictures of me do
   nothing in this regard.
