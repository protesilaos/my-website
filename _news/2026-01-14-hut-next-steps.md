The new battery for my solar panels gives me electricity around the
clock. I am happy with it. I am also pleased with the planning and
hard work I did to (i) have an admittedly imperfect place to stay,
(ii) be able to generate income in the meantime, (iii) save money for
the battery, (iv) arrange for the purchase of the item, (v) handle its
installation.

The patience and attentiveness I have shown thus far underpins the
overall hut project. I have been improving it little-by-little. The
longer-term goal is to have a house that is suitable for the average
person: that may cover other people but, most likely, it is just about
my future self.

As of this writing, I am not average in terms of resilience: I can
live under a rock and have endured some extremely uncomfortable
situations. This may not be a good thing because of how it conditions
me to tolerate sustained discomfort without saying anything about it
(i.e. "be vulnerable"), but is who I am and have proven that I get
results.

## Heating

At around 07:00 this morning the temperature indoors was 6 degrees
Celsius. There is snow at the highest peaks, but nothing out of the
ordinary. At noon it rises up to 15 degrees Celsius, thanks to the
direct sunlight. I always dress well and do physical activities (long
walks and/or manual labour) that help me keep my core temperature
high. But the house has to be viable even in the scenario where I am
not at my best (e.g. if I suffer an injury) or have to host another
person (like an elderly relative). I thus want to bring the room
temperature to around 20 degrees Celsius.

I looked around for heating units. Anything that needs to generate a
lot of heat is energy-intensive. I do not like that because it will
fail me when I need it the most, i.e. on a dark and extra cold day
like those we had the past week.

The most viable option seems to be an air conditioning unit. The
prices are comparable, so the criterion is the electricity profile.
Air conditioning seems to be less energy-intensive, though I have to
confirm that. I also need to determine what exactly do I need to
install one, as I have not done it before (I will do all the work
myself, of course, otherwise the price doubles or triples to
prohibitive levels).

Realistically, I can have this project done for the winter of 2028 or
beyond. It depends on my income.

## Insulation

This is a multi-stage project to improve the building's resilience to
cold, heat, and water. I have already done the water-proofing of the
roof. There still are two corners at the base of the house that leak a
tiny bit of water on intensely rainy days. I will fix those in the
coming spring or summer at the latest.

Resistance to heat is subject to the walnut trees I have strategically
planted around the house. They need about three to five more years of
growth before they can cast their shadow on my rooms. That aside, I
planned the house at the outset (of course I did the architecture
myself) to have windows on all opposite ends in order to optimise air
circulation (the other optimisation is maximum exposure to direct
sunlight based on the position of the sun at the winter solstice). It
gets warm here at the peak of summer, but it is manageable. With the
trees it will be comfortable.

I can reinforce all the walls with an extra layer of material. I am
thinking of adding it to the exterior, because this gives me maximum
flexibility from a construction point of view: the interior is not
uniform due to the metallic skeleton that holds everything together,
plus there are cables for the electricity and the power outlets.

Industrial products now include patterns such as faux brick, so that
might be a little extra touch to consider, though my priority is the
function it will perform. A generic grey gets the job done just as
well, but if the cost is the same then I will think about what I like
more.

Insulation is the single best upgrade I can make to my house from now
on. Depending on what I can achieve, it might even eliminate the need
for a heating solution altogether.

Assuming all goes well, I can place an order for the materials before
the end of 2026 and start construction work in the spring/summer of
2027.

## Floor work

The floor needs to be improved. Right now it is the concrete I had
initially built. This works but (i) it is cold and (ii) get dusty. The
goal is to apply an extra layer of material on top. I am prepared to
do tiling work, though all the tiles I found on the local market are
expensive. Perhaps there is some kind of mineral that is relatively
cheap. I do not need it to be fancy, just to seal off the concrete
below once I combine it with cement. I may also want to apply an extra
layer of synthetic material above it, such as some laminated surfaces
that caught my attention, but I need to sort out the basis first.

The floor work is still indeterminate. I must find the most viable
option for me and then plan accordingly. So probably during the summer
of 2028 or later.

## Home appliances

I will eventually need all the common home appliances. The immediate
priority is a fridge and then a washing machine: spring or
summer 2026. Then I can think about "nice extras", such as a
dishwasher. Though those will be done after all of the aforementioned.

## Stability and consistency

Things are looking good. There still is a lot to be done. I continue
with the same intensity. Up until this point, my focus was on the
absolute essentials. Namely, to have a roof over my head, to guarantee
that it is safe, and to make it have electricity all day (off-grid
solar panels with a battery). I thus cleared the land, built the
house, installed the solar panels, created the electricity cabin that
houses the inverter, battery, and combiner box, and did the
flood-control infrastructure by the stream. Plus all the labour on my
land to plant trees and herbs, improve resistance to soil erosion, do
stairways, and many more. I am confident in my ability to finalise
this project. It is a matter of having favourable circumstances, which
I try to affect as best I can.
