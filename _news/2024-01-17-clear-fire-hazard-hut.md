This is another status update on the hut project. I am clearing the
side of the hillock where the solar panels are. I must remove all
overgrown vegetation because it poses a fire hazard during summertime.
I am doing now before it grows further in size (and thus is more
difficult to deal with). My dogs also appear in the foreground at some
point in the video.
