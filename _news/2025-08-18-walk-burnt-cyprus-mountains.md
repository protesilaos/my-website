In this ~30-minute video I walk through my mountains to check how
things are after the wildfires of July (which I posted about here:
<https://protesilaos.com/news/2025-07-25-dealt-cyprus-wildfires/>).
The landscape is all ash, which stretches as far as the eye can see. I
was hoping to find some new plants growing and did indeed spot some
caper. Nothing else though. The absence of vegetation changes the
sensation of walking in the mountains, as I no longer hear any of the
familiar sounds caused by leaves and tree branches against the wind.
It feels like I am on a desolate planet and it is lonely. Other than
the wildfires, the land is suffering from severe drought. We generally
have issues with lack of precipitation, but this year is especially
bad. These are the lands close to my hut that I walk through daily and
I am disheartened to see them in this condition. Nature will recover.
All I can hope for is that the path forward is sustainable.
