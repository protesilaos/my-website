title: 'Introducing the "news and announcements" section'
excerpt: "The news section is where Protesilaos Stavrou publishes updates on his latest work."
---
The [news and announcements](https://protesilaos.com/news/) section of my website will be used to share information about my work that falls outside the scope of my existing blogs (politics, coding, ...). For example, when I publish my next book, I will post the relevant details here.

There is a [corresponding RSS feed](/news.xml) to help you keep track of the occasional update.

If unsure, refer to the [feeds](https://protesilaos.com/feeds/) page for information about RSS feeds and available content indices/streams on *protesilaos.com*.

If still unsure, [contact me](https://protesilaos.com/contact/).
