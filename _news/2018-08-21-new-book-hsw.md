title: 'New book: "On Human Self Worth"'
excerpt: 'Announcement about my latest philosophical work'
---
I just published a new work on philosophy.

*On Human Self Worth* is available free of charge and freed from
traditional copyright restrictions.  It is distributed under the
terms of the *Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Licence (CC
BY SA) 4.0*.

You can [read the book online](https://protesilaos.com/hsw/) or visit its
[print-optimised page](https://protesilaos.com/hsw/print/) to get a physical copy.

Maybe you will enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it. Feel
free to [contact me](https://protesilaos.com/contact/) if you have any comments or found
something that does not seem right.
