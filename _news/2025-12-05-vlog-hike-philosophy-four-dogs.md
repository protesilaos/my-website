[ Also read the poem I wrote based on the closing words of this video:
  [When you are in the wilds](https://protesilaos.com/poems/2025-12-04-when-in-the-wilds/). ]

In this 1-hour video I show one of my usual hikes with my four dogs. I
first talk about the surgery Atlas had and then start commenting on my
surroundings. This eventually turns into a philosophical commentary on
the importance of putting things in perspective. I discuss fear,
beauty, and the ease with which we can conduct ourselves once
something has been embedded as second nature. Throughout the video I
also make asides, such as to describe the vegetation around me and
remark on what my dogs are doing.
