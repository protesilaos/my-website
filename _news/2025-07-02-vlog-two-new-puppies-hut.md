In this video I introduce my two puppies, Meelon (Milon, Μίλων) and Oreeon (Orion, Ωρίων), which are pronounced as "MEE lon" and "O REE on", respectively. They join my other two dogs, Atlas and Raizou. The puppies are less than two months old. I was expecting to get them at the end of July but plans changed. Now they are getting used to their new pack. All canine members are casual about the situation and are adapting gracefully. I have the experience to handle dogs and know how to both condition and train them properly. The puppies are already learning new skills from me and are having a lot of fun. Given this opportunity, I talk about dog handling in general, with an emphasis on the importance of consistency and longer-term commitment.
