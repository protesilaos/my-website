There is no standalone presence in which a human being experiences
itself as such.  The person is immersed in a supersystem of systems of
relations between multitudes of other forms of being, including humans:
a joint presence, an interdependent existence.  To experience the self,
to assert one's individuality, is to be part of such cosmic oneness, the
totality of joint presences, in which there develops a feedback loop of
impressions that consists of internal and external actions and
reactions.

The ego, one's sense of self as the mental construct that is associated
with any given person, is iterated through such a feedback loop as a
collection of experiences that are selectively memorised and rendered
lucid in the form of a narrative.  It tells a story of who one is in
juxtaposition to who they are not.  In the ego lies subjectivity;
subjectivity that is contextualised in the oneness of being and is,
therefore, a type of _partiality_ rather than _individuality_ in the
literal sense of a non-divisible entity.

To ascribe individuality to personhood is to identify a pattern in the
cosmos that captures a system of systems and conceptualise it as such:
the human presence is itself divisible into systems of systems, with the
peculiar supersystem of human qua human functioning as the emergent form
of being conceived as a person in its own right.

Each ego is unique because each form of being, humans included, partakes
of the mode of phenomenal differentiation that runs through everything
there is, while each configuration of factors, in their given interplay,
that contributes to events peculiar to any one of those feedback loops
is unique as well.

Differentiation pertains to phenomena that are otherwise couched in
terms of constants.  Similarity does not become dissimilarity: the two
categories remain distinct.  While differentiation does not alter the
formal qualities of each presence, such as the seed of an apple tree
randomly engendering an elephant.  The mode of phenomenal
differentiation contributes to otherwise marginal or incremental
adjustments to any given presence, without forcing it to deviate from
its type and without interfering with categories of the cosmic abstract
structure.

The ego is an abstraction from such incessant differentiation.  It does
not describe a person's reality, rather it encapsulates one's simplified
version of some events.  To conflate the ego with individuality per se
is to misunderstand the inescapable totality one is immersed in.

Individuality, strictly so-called, is an illusion made possible by the
mode of phenomenal differentiation in conjunction with how the human
mind abstracts patterns into discrete mental constructs.  Individuality
is the _in vitro_ representation of _in vivo_ partiality.

Discreteness of mental or noetic presences is not arbitrary, in that it
does derive through the process of tracing patterns and identifying in
them that which is common in the multitude of phenomena.  Furthermore,
the mode of phenomenal differentiation does not disturb archetypes,
meaning that it does not undo the ontic distinction between forms of
being, or between strata of emergence understood as systems of systems
each giving rise to a particular kind of a case-dependent emergent
presence.

Distinctiveness does not entail individuality, for each form of being is
rendered possible in its particular milieu: it does not have a
standalone presence.  Differentiation does not annul the underlying
interconnectedness that all forms of being partake of and the
interdependence, else joint existence, they are bound to.

Individuality describes the noetic representation of a state of
emergence, not a form of being.  It presents a given stratum in a system
of systems as irreducible, as an entity in its own right that is not
contextualised by totality.  To speak of one's ego _as being_ is to
posit the illusion of individuality as the actuality of things under the
scope of cosmic oneness.

To recognise the impression of individuality as actual partiality is to
refrain from dogmatic reasoning.  It is to suspend judgement about what
one thinks one knows and to admit that, in light of totality, one is but
a fraction.

There is, nonetheless, practical reasonableness that applies to
interpersonal affairs, as well as in relations between humans and the
non-human aspects of their ecosystem, i.e. the system of systems that
renders possible life as we know it.  In practical terms, human conduct
rests on simplifications, working hypotheses, and abstractions.  Each
partiality can only be expressed as such.

In the stratum of emergence that involves human affairs, individuality
does make sense as an expedient mental shortcut: it is intimately linked
to the unfolding---the making and remaking---of one's ego.  Still, the
human world can only enable individuality as an approximation and
individualism as nothing but a simplistic ideology in justification of
states of affairs in the domain of politics.

Cosmic oneness aside, there is no standalone presence even within the
narrow confines of the human world, for there always exists a
precondition of sustainability.  A single human cannot survive without
either the direct cooperation or support of other humans, or the
reliance on artefacts that have been perfected through aeons of
experimentation among generations of humans as compounds of accumulated
knowledge: tools, weapons, inherited automations internalised as
instincts as well as experience passed down through tradition and
education, language with which to reason about the world in more precise
terms...

Tales of individuals that decisively operate outside the human world are
myths that inform a given ideology, or exaggerations that seek to bestow
a layer of plausibility upon a certain dogma.  A romanticised figure
living for a while in a hut amid the woods, or a hermit in some cave,
does not count as proof of a standalone presence even in the narrow
sense of the human world, for such a persona is already endowed with the
gifts of civilisation and remains dependent on them.

Similarly, a single human stripped of all goods of civilisation cannot
exist without an environment that is conducive to living: how will a
baby survive in the wilderness or how will a grown up with no tools and
weapons or prior knowledge succeed in a forest with competing predators
or hazards of any sort?

Individualism removed from its ontological pretences can be employed as
an instrument for research, as a specialised methodology that is part of
a wider programme that seeks to tie together findings of subjectivities
as ultimately framed by---and contributing to---their milieu.  Here too,
methodology must not become a tacit ontology in that it must not lose
sight of its intended function as a set of heuristics, a collection of
working hypotheses, in pursuit of general findings.

Methodological individualism that insists on there being no strata of
emergence, even of the human sort as intersubjectivity, mistakes
partiality for individuality, the _in vivo_ with the _in vitro_.  In so
doing it stands as an obstacle to a genuine inquiry into personhood, for
it strips it of its contextuality, in that it downplays the feedback
loop between internal and external actions and reactions.

To make sense of the human world without committing to dogmatism of such
a kind, one needs to balance out conceptions of personal and collective
subjectivity in an open-ended, dubitative and inquisitive fashion (see
[The Dialectician’s Ethos](https://protesilaos.com/ethos-dialectic)).
Recognise the so-called individual in their lifeworld as a partial
presence.  More so when embedding one's understanding of the human world
in discourses of ecology, i.e. under the scope of the system of systems
within which humanity operates.

To deny the contextuality of presence within the human world is to
disregard structural magnitudes that are discerned in the constitution
of each case.  Individualism qua method can only be implemented as a
microscopic view of ego-involving, ego-forming phenomena.  An altogether
different approach, one calibrated for intersubjectivity in present time
and for intergenerational dynamics on a historical scale, must be
established as its macroscopic complement to study the structure that
frames agency and is informed by it.

Against such a backdrop, it is fecund to reason about individual and
collective experiences, for the indivisible unit is thus understood as
an analytical construct within explicitly defined strata of emergence.
The person, here representing the atom of the case, is contextualised in
their cultural and historical milieu and is framed in relation to the
structural magnitudes that are peculiar to each state of affairs under
consideration.

There is, nonetheless, a particular sense in which individuality as
non-divisibility is an appropriate characterisation: in the very
functioning of the ego as an introspective view of personhood removed
from its wider context.  What the ego thinks of itself is what the ego
ultimately is.  We must consider it a constant with itself.  It is an
identity.  That does not make it immutable: it just means that at any
moment it resolves to what it is.

The ego as individuality is yet another instrument for pursuing an
inquiry into the specifics of that aspect of human kind.  It is a
heuristic with which to test certain hypotheses and, potentially, arrive
at more refined theories.  Still, the ego does not maintain a standalone
presence, even within the simplified constraints of a singular human
organism, as the ego is not its own cause.  The 'individuality'
discussed here applies to a very specific stratum of emergence and
remains limited to it.

Treating the singular human organism as a form of being that partakes of
partiality equips us with the means to examine the world with humility,
without fear and prejudice.  We may no longer conceptualise it as the
mere environment of any given centre, as in the case of anthropocentrism
and its individualist or egoist flip-side.  The same goes for human
affairs, where a broadened conception of the human experience as both a
function of structural magnitudes and contributor to macro phenomena
which themselves iterate on the structure (a circular process), helps us
avoid pitfalls of simplistic or pernicious ideologies that are casually
articulated as authoritative wisdom.
