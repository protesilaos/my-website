In [Metaphysics](http://classics.mit.edu//Aristotle/metaphysics.html),
Aristotle entertains the notion of an original cause that causes but is
not caused by anything: the unmoved mover or the prime mover.  It
follows logically by tracing the chain of causation back to its source.
If C is due to B and B happens because of A, then what triggers A to
engender B is the initial cause of this catenation of presences.  What
then causes that one?  And what comes before it?  The regression can
only lead us to a starting point where this putative original cause must
be.  Such is not a locus or indeed a tangible thing, but an analytical
construct that derives from the deduction of something being caused by
something else.

The notion of a prime mover can be interpreted as a theological
statement, where a divine power has created the world out of nothing.
There broadly are, however, two issues with that approach:

1. Is "from nothing" a statement on non-Being?  If so, then one reaches
   the terminus of human's faculties of sense and intellect.  For to
   describe that which is not is to attempt to attribute properties and,
   in so doing, to render the construct they are fastened upon or are
   assigned to as being: they are predicated on something, not on
   nothing.  Human mind can conceive of non-Being analytically as the
   opposite of Being, though to experience or describe something is
   indeed to be concerned with _some thing_, i.e. a form of being.  To
   reason about non-Being is to reason about Being, just as to speak of
   the ineffable is to talk about that which is being discussed, which
   is not ineffable as such.

2. Setting aside the impossibility of non-Being as being, a state in
   which some divine entity produces something out of absolutely nothing
   is still not one of non-Being, as there is the presence of that
   entity to account for.  So "absolutely nothing" is not true.  Which
   would compel us to pursue the Aristotelean enterprise further to
   inquire upon the causes of that very entity: what is the cause of
   such a presumed divine power?  What about the cause's cause?  And so
   on until we return to where we started wondering about the unmoved
   mover.

To resolve the problem, one may posit a hypothesis that is complementary
to Aristotle's linear sequencing: what may be described schematically as
circular that admits to work within the confines of Being instead of
trying and inevitably failing to escape the boundaries of human
potential.  That which causes but is not caused by anything must be the
cause of its own and everything else must be predicated on it, for that
which causes _is_ and that which causes ultimately still _is_, actuality
per se.  Being always is, neither was nor will be, to the effect that
the prime mover is Being.

If one supposes that there exists just the divine qua prime mover on one
side and nothingness on the other, then there is at least a third or
rather more fundamental magnitude that frames, informs, determines, and
preconditions the two, together forming oneness where the dichotomy
between exo- and endo- oneness dissolves into itself.  To think of an
otherwise self-contained chain reaction that is brought about by a force
external to it is to inevitably admit the point of contact and to
implicitly recognise an environment where the connection can be
established between the mover and the moved.  Again, the dichotomy does
not hold in absolute terms.

What are discerned as patterns in this universal oneness are derivatives
of Being that always come and go from something into something.  Not
from nothing into something nor from something into nothing.  All are
embedded in Being, essentially inseparable from each other as systems of
systems, each governed by local and global rules, each environed by
others and contributing to the interplay of factors that engender
emergent phenomena; systems of systems in strata of emergence and so on
recursively within a cosmic supersystem; never as standalone presences
and only as instances of partiality rather than individuality as such.

Being is represented as a circle in that it is its own cause and it
always is.  Though predicate or higher forms of being beyond the
universal fundamentals are best described as a helix, due to the mode of
phenomenal differentiation---itself a constant---in which no combination
of innumerable factors ever repeats itself.  There is no cosmic rewind
and replay, as in a one-to-one reenactment, but interdependent and
compounding adaptations between the constituents in each and every
super- and sub- system of the cosmos.

The helix and the circle are not in conflict, such as in the case of a
vortex where a circular motion at the centre of a body of water
generates the helix-like flow.  Remember though that those are schematic
representations with which to communicate, not to be captured by them in
trying to identify perfect correspondence between the metaphor and
reality.

How come there are forms in oneness?  Due to emergence, which is an
epiphenomenon, or rather concatenation of epiphenomena, of Being.
Fundamentally there is Being.  Forms of being are emergent realities
that are derived from lower level fundamentals through the complex
interplay of the factors in each case.  Just as there can be conscience
at one stratum of emergence, there can be at others.  There is no clear
indication that emergence reaches a finality, such as, say, the
sequencing from the atoms to the organs to the supersystem called
"human" producing the phenomenon of conscience to ever stop at that
level and for there to be no such emergence from fungi to plants and
forests and oceans to planets to solar systems and galaxies, et cetera.
If it is known to be made manifest in one place, or under a given set of
circumstances, why would it not be reproduced in another constitution of
the case, mutatis mutandis?

(2020-02-29). ]

Emergence does not explain the reason of being instead of not being, so
why does the unmoved cause motion?  One cannot determine a precise
reason for why Being causes other things to derive from it and return to
it.  What one can tell is that there can be no non-Being and that forms
of being always are inter-dependent and jointly existent.

Suppose Being somehow revealed itself to us and explained what the
reason is for beings to exist instead of not existing---would that
suffice?  One would not be justified in providing assent to such claims,
for one lacks the means to verify them independently.  Human can only
ever conceive that which is in the nature of human to conceive and,
consequently, one can never think, imagine, comprehend that which is not
possible for human to ever think, imagine, comprehend.  A revelation of
the sort here considered that is formulated in a way which is
understandable by humans is one that necessarily is within humanity's
potentiality and, therefore, constitutes a claim or set thereof that one
ought to be able to confirm rather than take at face value.  One must,
in other words, remain dubitative and inquisitive.

What is the relationship between the idea of this article and this
article, or between the idea of this article and the idea of article as
such?  Do ideas exist and are they somehow mixed together with some
matter in order to be instantiated?  Ideas exist in a basic way that is
reducible to energy and so the instantiation of an idea does share a
part with its noetic counterpart through the transformation of energy
into matter, though not as partaking of a finite quantity as in how a
loaf of sourdough bread derives from the dough of an older bread.  The
instantiation of this article consists of bits in the computer or ink on
paper, if you will, though there is no computer hardware, ink, paper in
its author's mind.  Yet the idea of this article is imprinted in this
article, while the totality of all possible articles does not exhaust
the idea of article, for it is not finite.  It is intriguing then that
the aforementioned epiphenomena of motion lead to an animal that can
entertain ideas; which would suggest that intelligence of varying
degrees must be immanent to the cosmos rather than germane to human, as
there is nothing unique in human qua human.  For what else is the
pre-programmed, yet sufficiently self re-programmable, behaviour of the
seed (or indeed of anything that grows and evolves) that gives a tree,
which gives seeds, and so more trees, and the same in an eternal process
of compounding adaptation that actually co-occurs in all forms of being?
Just as human consists of what may be described in a sense as 'star
dust'---water, iron, and the like---so must it inherit everything else
that is prevalent.

Why argue against nothingness when this article came into being from
nothing?  It did not come from nothing, nor in nothing, nor of nothing.
There always is something.  Instantiations come an go, just as one
animal is born and eventually dies without exhausting or depleting some
resource pertaining to its type of being.  Under the scope of Being,
life and death are not distinct as they are part of the same process of
composition and decomposition from something into something.  Life and
death, presence or absence, are felt differently at different strata of
emergence, because each stratum is but a part of the cosmic whole, so it
does not have the complete circle peculiar to it.  Think of it like a
pulse, a cosmic dance, that pulls together 'star dust': when it is
assembled you live, when it disassembles you cease to be, though the
pulse continues pulling and pushing 'star dust'.

What if there is some substantive difference between the cosmos and
whatever caused it, such as how a computer program can procedurally
create its own realities within the confines of the program without
being the same as its human creator?  What if there is a true substance
in some other state and the cosmos as we know and can imagine it is just
a grand illusion, so to speak, or some sort of an empty shell?  One
would still have to reason about such truly substantive state in the
same way we have already outlined, namely, that everything humanity may
posit about it is strictly limited to Being.  The supposed truly
substantive state would then be one of Being, not non-Being, and the
unmoved mover, else that which causes but is not caused by anything,
would have to be the cause of its own.  Furthermore, the distinction
between exo and endo in that state would continue to be meaningless, for
if it were contained by something it would not be genuinely the prime
mover and we would thus have to press on with our research until we
found the circularity outlined herein.

Giving it a different name does not solve our problem.  We always return
to universal interconnectedness, to oneness.
