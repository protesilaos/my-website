In this 27-minute video, I elaborate on the most important quality of
the philosopher: patience. I use the example of walking as one of the
best ways each of us can practice the skill of being patient. Walking
is nice because it is a commitment we cannot renege on midway: we
simply have to finish it properly. It also gives us the chance to get
used to our natural pace and to not rush things to a conclusion. In
essence, we learn not to finish off early. Moreover, we start
developing situational awareness by observing the little things all
around us. This makes us have presence in our present: a quality that
is essential to all tasks we do if we want to do them right by giving
them our undivided attention. In this sense, I explain why other
gimmicks and aspirational tasks do not work. Finally, I discuss how we
are an embodies mind, meaning that the training we subject the body to
is benign for our thinking. We have tranquillity when our body gets
used to the rigours we subject it to, so it does not panic and get all
needy for no good reason.
