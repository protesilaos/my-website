[La trahison des
images](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images), else
_The Treachery of Images_ by René Magritte, is a painting that
challenges one's basic intuitions of what lies in front of their own
eyes.  The painter presents us with a realistic depiction of a pipe,
with the caption "This is not a pipe" ("Ceci n'est pas une pipe").  The
paradox resolves once one realises that they are merely looking at a
painting of a pipe, not a pipe as such.

Does that really solve the problem?

The difference between a painting and a pipe consists, at the face of
it, in their intended and expected functions.  Intent is the role that
object was meant to assume in the case envisaged by its creator.  It can
also refer to what its user wants it to do at the moment.  While
expectations pertain to the same role as conceived by those who may
interface with it under certain circumstances, or in the particular
constitution of the case.

A painting can be said to realise its telos in educating, entertaining,
or otherwise appealing to the aesthetic and intellectual sensitivities
of the subject who experiences it.  Yet a painting also potentially
functions as its creator's claim on an achievement: a token which one
may exchange for recognition among their peers, material wealth, and the
like.  Still, the making of a painting, the process itself, is not
necessarily subordinate to considerations of social status and economic
standing, for the artist produces art to satisfy their own call to
express themselves through that medium.

What is a painting in one case is not the same in another.  The painting
as a product of art is not equivalent to the painting which is placed at
the auction house where its likely buyers are financial investors who
assiduously seek to hedge their bets by attaching them to the asset of a
perhaps much vaunted luxury good.  The intended role in the former scenario
is largely cultural, while in the latter it is business-centric.  The
same painting is presented as distinct from itself when the constitution
of the case is refashioned: its roles ante and post such a change
differ.

For there to be a painting that is understood in its capacity as a work
of art there has to be an environment that is conducive to such an
appreciation; a set of contributing factors which, in their interplay,
substantiate such a role; an environment that assigns meaning to the
painting and determines whether that coincides with the intent of its
creator or user[s].

In the absence of an appropriate environment, there is no painting qua
art.  There may be the raw materials, such as canvas or wood with oil
colours laid on top, but the meaning, the one that is contextually
developed as an intersubjective narrative, remains latent or not
actualisable.  Matter is not a painting.  Matter in a given form is
still not a painting.  Matter in a given form plus a meaning assigned to
it can be a painting under specific circumstances.

One must then expect a contemporary painter to present their work with
the caption "This is not a painting a priori... though you can interpret
it as one".

This is not a pipe...  It is the representation of a pipe: a painting.
Or is it?  Can a painting be properly talked about without considering
the technical aspects that are peculiar to its art, such as the colour
combinations in use, the shapes, the strokes of the brush, the contrast
of light and shadow?  Is there a painting for which one can never
discern the elements of its artistry or otherwise not be concerned with
them in the slightest, as we do in this article, yet continues to be
treated as a painting?  For what we are commenting on is not the
painting as that which has been painted in its totality, but only the
paradox represented therein.  Is the paradox itself, detached from its
underlying colouration, texture, etc., the painting of René Magritte?
Or must it be framed as an element or a particular quality of it?  And
if it is an element that we choose to study in its own right, is our
study still about the painting?

Could René Magritte be incorrect in their claim that _Ceci n'est pas une
pipe_?  The statement is imprecise, or can at least be read in ways that
its writer did not foresee, as it assumes that "pipe" can only signify
that object which is used for the particular function of smoking, or of
smoking tobacco.  Yet as with the painting, a pipe can never have a
singular and predetermined function independent of the milieu it is
immersed in.  Just as with the painting, the pipe does not exist without
an appropriate environment that bestows upon it a role.  Which suggests
that while the pictorial instantiation of the pipe is not the pipe qua a
special implement for smoking, it still is, in a sense, the unmistakable
depiction of a pipe, as its impression corresponds with the one we get
while observing a tangible pipe: oh, this is a pipe!

Consider now René Magritte as the agency of the painter during the
moments when _La trahison des images_ was being painted.  One can only
assume that the painter sits in their studio with a tangible pipe
positioned at some distance from where the painting is being drawn.
That pipe in the studio, under those particular circumstances, is also
not a pipe in the sense of an object that is being used to smoke
tobacco, because the painter assigns to it an entirely new role without
necessarily rendering obsolete its previous one: the new role of a still
nature, a model whose purpose is to be observed and the impression of
which is to be expressed as a form within the painting and then be
altered anew by the inclusion of the caption which introduces the
paradox discussed herein.

One could argue that a pipe is a pipe only insofar as it conforms with
its intended purpose of smoking tobacco.  However that line of reasoning
introduces an arbitrary stratification in the multitude of possible
contextual functions of the pipe, where it treats the intent of its
creator as somehow superior to that of its user[s] in all possible
states of affairs, with the creator also becoming a user.  There is
nothing intrinsic to pipe in general or to this very pipe as originally
conceived that prevents it from attaining a function which is peculiar
to the constitution of the case.  The actuality of any given presence is
neither predetermined nor unalterable: it is always realised as a
quality that stands emergent from the interplay of factors constituting
the case.

Think about the pipe that René Magritte painted; the particular pipe in
its specific capacity as the famous object that Magritte used in the
studio to perform the role of the still nature that ultimately informed
_La trahison des images_.  Suppose that this pipe is retrieved from
Magritte's belongings and is placed in a museum.  Is it still a pipe in
the sense of actually being used to smoke tobacco?  Or has it yet again
attained a function that is specific to its newfound role as an exhibit
in the museum?  One must then wonder what it means for something to be
couched in terms of a cultural exhibition: what is the intended function
of the exhibit as derived from the context it is in and what are the
concomitant expectations of those involved.  And the same principles
apply when that very pipe gets sold to another institution for an
inordinate amount money: is the buying agent paying for the original
intended function of the pipe or for the peculiar intersubjective
meaning it attained through the history of art?  Or perhaps something
else entirely?

Thus our problem is not whether the representation of a presence is the
presence itself in those cases where a distinction between the two
magnitudes can be maintained, but that there can be no decontextualised
telos as there is no standalone presence.  Something exists in
something, not in nothing.

The original intended role of any given presence cannot precondition or
otherwise constrain its evolving actuality.  The actual is situational.
It is contingent on sets of relations between presences where the
presences and their relations evolve or generally change to deliver
unique configurations which in turn engender their own emergent
realities.  To insist on the original or intended role of a presence is
to disregard the indeterminate nature of its actuality as such, or to
dogmatically assume it as constant.
