Science is the activity of tracing patterns in phenomena, equipped with
a method of standardising and then distinguishing relevant from
irrelevant findings in a manner that does not presuppose indoctrination
in the conceptional apparatus from whence the search for the data
originates, and communicating in a style that values precision of
statement and clarity of concept over persuasion through means that do
not appeal to reason.  The observation and concomitant measurement of
the particularities of the case leads to the formation of theories that
seek to both explain and systematise the raw inputs and, subsequently,
facilitate the formulation of hypotheses for the identification of new
patterns, which renew the cycle of pattern recognition and analysis.

Science is, in this regard, a certain way of accumulating knowledge;
knowledge that is a function of the available evidence and, which, by
the very nature of the imperfect state of the totality of human
instruments, the particularity, indeterminacy, or incompleteness of
facts as well as the multitude of possible ways they can be interpreted
and combined, must be understood as a form of proximate or intermediate
certitude rather than the absolute truth.

Science implements a method of verifying and reasoning about facts that
is external to science: that of identifying particular patterns and
confirming their exact behaviour through continuous observation and
experimentation.  The method of science qua method that cannot possibly
supply the means of its own verification or be its own cause and
justification, for one may not prove with facts that which remains
abstract.  The method derives from philosophy which can afford to be
self-reflective because one can theorise about theories or a given
concept in abstract.  Scientists may conduct an inquiry on their method,
though they must do so outside the narrow confines of their role as
scientists.

Science does not discount its significance nor does it undermine its own
work by recognising the essence of the method it applies as exogenous to
it.  Nor does the recognition of this principle suggest that philosophy
is necessarily a more truthful discipline in general and must thus be
applied to every aspect of life.  It only shows that there are different
scopes of application in what effectively are strata of abstraction in
the systems where patterns are identifiable, each with its own
peculiarities and each imposing its own set of requirements upon the
truth-seeker.  By delineating the boundaries within which scientific
initiative unfolds, scientists are better prepared to guard against
their own excesses by disaggregating with a critical mindset the
independently verifiable claims from those that are unwarranted or
otherwise products of fabulation though they may be prima facie resting
on a kernel of intermediate certitude.

Science recognises the inconclusiveness of its assertions as expedient
approximations that can inform further research; research that attempts
to reveal theretofore unknown mysteries and recast existing knowledge in
a new light.  The intermediate state of scientific knowledge taken as a
whole inspires scientists to press on with their work in the hope of
further approximating the truth, given that the feedback loop of search
and discovery is largely positive.

Science commits to the deciphering of the given case's constitution and,
by logical necessity, accepts the possible revaluation of its
conclusions, including their total dismissal, once either the factors
that constitute the case, or the means of assessing them, undergo
change.  Intermediate knowledge is contingent on the overall mutability
of the case, with the proviso that some classes of scientific findings
may be much more stable than others and can thus function as foundations
upon which ongoing research programmes may be established.  Neither the
method of science nor the findings it yields are immune to
reconsideration and recalibration: they rather serve as a framework that
informs heuristic devices which remain relevant by their effectiveness
to deliver some degree of certitude.

Science can affect the mutability of the case by remaining open to the
possibility of reviewing what had hitherto worked.  A more refined
theory or an altogether different approach to a given problem can reveal
factors that were previously unknown and, in so doing, alter the
constitution of the case in its thinkable expression as what is thought
to be constituted of, which are its factors, what their interplay
involves, and what phenomena emerge from them.

Science implicitly understands that the constitution of the case is not
strictly objective, in the sense of being independent of the subject who
examines it.  For if a change in how a pattern is discerned can alter
the meaning or impression of it, it means that there exists a third
realm of interconnectedness that encompasses the subject and the object.
And so, objectivity in the particular sense of verification pertains to
the narrower meaning of freedom from indoctrination in the assessment of
scientific findings, where "indoctrination" amounts to a tacit
dependency on a certain line of reasoning to render the scientific
output verifiable.

Science employs the term "objectivity" to denote its own commitment to
research that is not self-serving.  If a given programme can only
explain itself within its own theoretical framework and if its own
theories must be accepted in advance through sheer faith in their
expected or putative eventual validity by invoking the hokum of
progress, it ultimately violates the principle of freedom from
indoctrination, as it only addresses its disciples in what effectively
is an echo chamber of social confirmation.  Conversely, the potential
presence of such a programme further reinforces the notion of
intermediate certitude which implies a sceptical view of one's conduct
inter alia.

Science, like philosophy, is a field of endeavour that requires a high
ethical standard in its agents in order to sustain itself and guard
against the formation of dogmas within its ranks.  Scientists need to be
guided by the joint virtues of dubitativeness, inquisitiveness,
humility, courage, and open-mindedness in the form of discursively
synthesising old and new ideas in pursuit of the truth rather than
insisting on the vanity of forwarding one's parochial interests or
seeking to vindicate one's school of thought by attempting to win the
argument in a decisively unphilosophical, winner-takes-it-all mindset.

Science that recognises the imperfections of its work, the
inconclusiveness of its own insights, and the possibility of making
mistakes that ultimately detract from its main cause though they may
appear compelling at first, is one that is prepared to press on with its
research programmes for the sake of further approximating the truth
instead of entertaining notions that are alien to that core objective.

Science is applied dialectics: a grand exchange of views where the
participants propound their propositions in a spirit of collaboration
with their peers towards the common end of the scientific enterprise.
Dialectics is about jointly investigating the truth of the topic in
question, where each side in this special type of dialogue maintains a
disposition of being eager to be proven wrong when faced with cogent
anti-theses to their own theses, for that necessarily emancipates them
from an earlier falsehood and puts them on a new path of moving towards
the truth.

[ Read: [The Dialectician’s Ethos](https://protesilaos.com/books/2020-09-30-ethos-dialectic/) (2020-09-30) ]

Science severed from its philosophical underpinnings can only be a stale
technical occupation that ultimately creates its own vapid fashions and
the related ephemeral social behaviours of hype and credulity.  Such a
science becomes an industry that specialises in producing the commodity
of half-truths or that of elaborate lies wrapped in jargon and carefully
selected data sets which conceal their underlying mischievous intent.
The industry of science is used by its sponsors to advance their own
stratagems, which are not aligned with those of science proper, for
science might indeed fail to account for all factors that constitute the
case though it will only do so temporarily out of an honest mistake not
due to an ulterior motive of some sort.  Scientists within such an
unphilosophical community inevitably lose sight of the norms of
dialectics, sacrificing them to the altars of expediency and vanity.
They seek to establish their own strata of power accumulation and then
work laboriously to reinforce their dogmas or myths of self-valorisation
which are to be protected and perpetuated by those at the top of the
resulting hierarchy in order to preserve benefits they have secured;
benefits which are indicative of corruption and have nothing to do with
the quest of approximating the truth.

Science without philosophy will inevitably experience such decline
because it will forget the requisite scepticism that reinvigorates the
process of iterative learning and re-learning which is characteristic of
science: a process that is imperfect by default, else its continuation
would be superfluous.  Dialectics is not about delivering the truth in
an unequivocal fashion.  It rather is the recognition that truthfulness
as such is not within any one's grasp or is not confined to the
constitution of a case, and so intermediate certitude must be pursued in
an incrementalist way as an inter-personal and then inter-generational
effort where everyone involved tries to prepare their findings for the
type of objectivity that science expects (freedom from indoctrination).
A science that no longer tolerates openendedness of that kind or that
cannot recognise its own temporality-specific shortcomings and
constraints is one that ultimately falls victim to conventions that are
essentially unscientific, such as the mythos of its own inexorable
linear progress where the new generation is believed to have fully
absorbed the wisdom of the previous one, so that there never is a need
to rewind or take a step back in an attempt to reconsider the state of
affairs.

Science without philosophy is thus bound to be instrumentalised by
forces with no genuine interest in the pursuit of the truth; forces
whose machinations find their telos in the accumulation of power in the
form of increasingly repressive or outright tyrannical governments, as
well as corporate or private actors whose sole objective is the
maximisation of wealth and control regardless of the invidious costs on
humanity and the ecosystem at-large.

Science of such a sort can only ever serve as the intellectual vanguard
of a profoundly non-scientific, and thus anti-philosophical, elite: to
perform the role of the supposed fountain of authoritative insight that
provides legitimacy to the status quo and which is ultimately weaponised
against those who dare challenge the establishment's hubris, its lack of
self-control and sense of place in the world, and its pretences on
infallibility.

Science deprived of philosophy and consequently transformed into the
means for the consolidation of a given economic-institutional
arrangement of forces must then rationalise its own condition through
narratives that have nothing to do with the basic notion of trying to
attain intermediate certitude for the matter at hand.  It must instead
find other means to retain its appeal, such as to invent its own origin
story that justifies its existence and necessity in the history of
humankind in general and the current civilisation in particular, and it
must also elaborate on its own eschatology of unmitigated further
enlightenment both to attract newcomers to its cause and to fend against
those who are not amused by the vainglory of an ostensibly godless
technotheocracy.

Science as a career choice rather than a disposition towards learning,
and an attitude of living in accordance with the principles than enable
such learning, contributes to the distancing from philosophy and to the
degradation of the moral character of those involved.  The practitioner
who has not been in the least exposed to the rigours of a virtuous modus
vivendi is likely to prioritise superficialities that obscure their own
intellectual insecurities, such as social status, a growing collection
of titles and certificates that are supposed to support one's appeal to
intellectuality, or the emptiness of being celebrated as a force for
so-called "progress" and "rationality" among those who are believed to
be unfortunate enough not to be scientists.  The latter is one of those
non-scientific beliefs amplified by the oligopoly of mass media that
helps the philosophically deprived science stake its claim as the
tutelary figure of the contemporary world, while blithely disregarding
its instrumentalisation as both the apologist and militant activist of
the power apparatus that enables it.

Science without philosophy becomes an ideology for the class of
scientists who promote their selfish needs and/or for those who exploit
scientific research in their quest for control.

Scientism is the ideology that holds science, though not necessarily
individual research programmes, as inherently unmistakable and as the
single source of truth.  It is a set of beliefs on the superiority of
science as a means of knowing the truth over any other method and a
prescription against modes of behaviour that are not backed by
scientific evidence which are deemed irrational, unreliable, or
otherwise unclear.  Scientism takes the form of a political initiative
to extend scientific methods to all aspects of collective living and to
make politics partake of the putative innate impartiality, rationality,
and corresponding sense of truthfulness of scientific insight, without
recognising the intertemporal failures of science between cycles of
research programmes to reach a state of satisfactory intermediate
certitude.  In the academic world, scientism translates as a belief in
the preponderance of natural sciences over the humanities and a
subsequent form of expansionism of the former class against the latter
or the induced envy of the latter of the former's social prestige and
access to funding.  For the individual professional, scientism functions
as a pretence on the scientist's moral neutrality, their indifference to
matters outside their area of specialisation, their self-imposed
censorship on topics beyond their field of research, and their ultimate
alienation from human affairs at-large.

Scientism starts from the misunderstanding that science alone speaks the
truth and that unless some statement is scientifically proven nothing
can be said about it with any degree of credibility.  What science finds
is, at best, the recognition of the case, which involves both subjective
and objective magnitudes as outlined above, meaning that the absolute
certitude that scientism expects is not acquirable.

Scientism makes a parody out of science by claiming that research
methods such as statistical analysis and modelling can be applied to
every aspect of life, on the presumption that those techniques are
inherently rigorous.  It thus leaves no room for non-mathematical forms
of expression, such as textual interpretation, art, and legal doctrine.
Taken to its extreme, scientism cannot admit the truthfulness one finds
in a painting, such as El Greco's *Portrait of a Cardinal* which depicts
the vanity and ruthlessness of Spain's then Inquisitor-General.

Scientism can only see other forms of acquiring knowledge as imperfect,
because it juxtaposes them with an idealised version of science; a
science where there are no cycles of revaluation and reconsideration of
existing findings or where those are somehow not relevant to the claim
that at any given moment science presents the truth.  Science
effectively proceeds through trial and error, to the effect that its
current state is a midpoint between phases of high uncertainty and a
degree of certitude.

Scientism prefers to obscure the dialectical---and, thus, sceptical---
philosophical underpinnings of science by conflating the precision of
statement that is typical of mathematics with the correspondence of
models to the actuality of the case.  A model codifies the assumptions
made by its designer and looks into what the scientist wanted to find.
It can have internal consistency, yet still fail to describe reality, as
the constitution of its case excludes factors whose inclusion would have
altered the way things appear to be.  The scientist who fails to draw
lessons from philosophy forgets that models are heuristic devices with
which to reason about states of affairs in order to draw inferences that
must inform the formulation of new hypotheses that advance research.  To
advance research is to render old models obsolete and to challenge prior
assumptions as incomplete, misguided, or outright fallacious.

Scientism's negligence to remain aporetic with respect to the models
that scientists employ forces it to develop a false sense of pride in
the medium of communication that consists of statistics and their
geometric portrayals.  The ideology thus assumes a combative stance
against research programmes that cannot be reduced to simplistic
mechanics of input and output.  In practice, scientism venerates the
so-called 'hard' sciences while deriding the 'soft' ones: it does so
already at the linguistic level by introducing the presumptuous
hard/soft dichotomy, but also by openly questioning the scientific
merits of programmes that involve interpretation and critical judgement.

Scientism thus unfolds as an offensive against classes of sciences that
do not yield what are believed to be solid facts.  Rhetoric and
prejudices aside, the sustained attack takes the form of an uneven
distribution of funding so that departments in disciplines such as
history, sociology, gender studies, are forced into the margins of the
academia, while their ostensibly superior and credible counterparts are
endowed with all the money and exposure.  What is the institutional
equivalent of NASA for studying the human condition, the interpersonal
magnitudes of our world, and how does it compare to NASA in terms of
status, media coverage, and funding?

Scientism does not ask such questions because it dismisses 'values' as
unscientific, as if science is not supposed to search for answers that
can help humans improve their understanding of the world, which
inevitably encompasses the understanding of their intersubjective world.
And so a group of self-proclaimed geeks or nerds will blithely launch
the rockets of some deranged plutocrat into outer space where they will
be used to eventually consolidate repression both on Earth and beyond.
Why bother going to Mars if the greatest aspiration is to set up more
banks with which to perpetuate the rapacious tendencies that already
dominate our life?

Scientism cannot nurture critical thinking from within; thinking that
could show it the error of its ways and point at its delusions on the
categorisation of the classes of human knowledge.  For it maintains the
unrealistic notion that the scientist has an agency that is distinct
from its counterpart in the outside world: once the scientist enters the
lab, or speaks their mind in their capacity qua scientist, they
mystically assume an enlightened form that is free of ideological
dispositions and deep seated biases; free from those 'human values' that
scientism is unwilling to recognise as pertinent to the human experience
and worthy of serious consideration.

Scientism promotes, in splendid non-scientific style, the ostensible
moral neutrality of the scientist because that is consistent with its
claims that only the supposed 'hard' evidence can be reasoned about with
rigour while everything else must be discarded as being of dubious
quality.  This ideocentric view of science is further reinforced by
powerful symbiotic interests of politics and business that benefit from
that image both because (i) the work of the research they fund appears
impartial and genuine, and (ii) the uncritically minded scientist will
not suspend their research programme to ponder about its propriety, its
telos.

Scientism further benefits from the myth that science, here conceived as
'hard' science, is a vehicle towards enlightenment as it is integral to
humanity's progress towards democracy from the earlier days of tyranny.
Notwithstanding the fact that the so-called democracies of the modern
world are oligarchies by design, there is nothing whatsoever in the
nature of applied research that prevents it from being employed in the
service of outright authoritarian regimes or used by assiduous and
unscrupulous corporate actors in pursuit of malicious and unscientific
ends.

Scientism contradicts its claims when it tries to identify itself with
liberty while undermining the significance of the humanities or liberal
arts.  The contradiction is, nonetheless, obscured by the narrative of
inexorable historical progress not only of the material sort but also in
terms of morality, which is encapsulated in clichés that point to the
thought of something being out of place or unacceptable "in the 21st
century".  Perhaps such apparent misreading of history and such inflated
sense of importance in the modern era's conventional wisdom would have
been prevented by paying attention to studies that examine the human
condition in earnest, contrary to the workings of scientism.

Scientism further contradicts itself on the point of being firmly
fastened upon the vehicle of democracy, because what it wants in the
domain of politics is for so-called experts to guide and mould society
as they see fit, despite the obvious shortcomings of actual science on
how the human world works.  There are experts who control monetary
policy, experts who advise the government on how to manage the economy,
experts who decide what is to be taught at schools---with the
indoctrination to scientism included---, experts who instruct farmers
what is best for their land, and so on, to the effect that asking for
the rest of society to participate in decisions that affect their
quotidian life, and to do so in a meaningful way instead of some
tokenistic engagement via hashtags on a platformarch's playground or
whatnot, is to promote some much-derided brand of populism.

Scientism thus denies the possibility of an ideologically driven
technocracy.  The scientist is supposed to an exalted being, morally
neutral qua scientist.  Science, in the scientism's sense, is meant to
be the instrument of secular providence that leads peoples towards
democracy and liberty.  And so, when a committee of experts issues its
edict on how collective life is to be instituted, it merely expresses
the epitome of impartiality, the purity of reason, and the undisputed
truth of what can be said about the subject at hand.  Same principle
when a group of scientists catalyses the making of some consumer good
that actually harms people to maximise profits, all under the guise of
objectivity and moral neutrality.

Scientism expresses itself in the words of the feeble willed scientist
who prefaces every opinion with the caveat "I specialise in X, therefore
I cannot speak about Y, though I think...".  An honest scientist who has
not lost sight of philosophy would simply admit that specialisation in X
does not yield perfect knowledge of X and that one is uncertain about
the validity of all of their views, despite whatever differences of
degree.  A genuine scientist would, in other words, not pretend to be
impartial and immune to bias, but would rather openly admit the
possibility of being mistaken, would acknowledge the fact that the
constitution of the case thus examined does not preclude the
reconstitution of the case if that is what the quest for the truth
demands and, in a spirit of dialectics, be eager to be proven wrong by
cogent arguments that contradict their prior fallacious views.

Scientism cannot tolerate dialectics, it cannot recognise the fact that
the scientist does not provide definitive answers, as that would expose
its hypocrisy and pose a hindrance to its aspirations of clinging on to
power.  It instead expounds on the asinine theory that philosophy is
outdated and no longer relevant to science which is, by itself, an
unequivocal assertion of the sort that genuine science dismisses as
unscientific as well as a misunderstanding of how philosophy informs
science not as a substitute for tinkering with equations and
recalibrating instruments, but as a means of being self-conscious of the
bigger picture in which one contributes their part, and a way of
thinking and operating that remains mindful of the very framework that
supports those equations and instruments.

Scientism endorses an unrealistic view of the current state of research
where it downplays the significance of competing schools of thought and
how not all of them are represented equally or at all in the
technocratic power structures.  The very presence of an orthodoxy and of
heterodox views in any given field of inquiry means that (i) the
discipline as a whole cannot be represented uniformly, (ii) the
historical evolution of the discipline will consolidate the power of
whatever mainstream tendency and not internalise those of competing
traditions so that the state-of-the-art will eventually be the
prevalence of the dominant persuasion in what effectively is a battle of
numbers.  Moreover, the existence of such differences of opinion or
approach indicates what science knows and what scientism disregards: the
truth remains elusive.

Scientism's integration with business and political plans has pernicious
implications in the world of science (in addition to the invidious
consolidation of technocracy, with its inane pretences on neutrality and
supposed apolitical outlook).  Those concern the struggle for prestige
and the related scramble for access to resources that are furnished by
those with the goal to forward their agenda behind the veil of
putatively authoritative science.

Scientism first engenders the demand for ostensibly undisputed evidence
in all areas of life by misrepresenting science as the single source of
truth and then accommodates that demand by turning science into yet
another industry that functions in accordance with the idolatry of
perpetual profit maximisation.  The scientist who is cast in that milieu
must think of how to market their research in order to get a grant that
can keep them in business.  While the humanities at-large must engage in
a grand role-playing game where they appear to be implementing the same
rigour that is found in physics so that they, too, can yield tangible
results for use by their sponsors.  Meanwhile, the aspiring scientist is
incentivised to assume---or, rather, brainwshed into assuming---an
odious debt burden in order to go through the now-industrialised and
hyper-financialised formal education system in the hope of acquiring a
degree or set thereof that improves their career prospects, including
the option of a career in science defined by its aphilosophical hubris.

Scientism is inextricably bound up together with the established
paradigm of political-economic-social organisation where a tightly
controlled elite appropriates the means of production, communication,
and decision-making.  Scientism provides the origin story of this
order's self-professed benevolence as the heir of modernity---itself an
ideologically loaded term---and renders plausible its claims on its
inevitability as the sole possible outcome of rational thinking, all
under the rubric of science alone being in a position to tend to the
truth.  As the status quo is defined by its inequality and amorality,
which are embedded in the profligate quest for incessant year-on-year
fiscal growth, so its simulacrum of science inherits the same antipathy
towards the truth when that poses a threat to its bottom line.

Scientism exists to regale its de facto employers with findings that can
be directly integrated in money-making schemes and power struggles, both
of which are consubstantial anyhow.  It exists to provide them with
legitimacy and to shield them from criticism, for who has the temerity
to question 'science' and 'facts'?
