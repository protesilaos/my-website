In this 30-minute video, I talk about the importance of knowing the
limits in whatever we are doing and of working with what we have. I
start by describing a saying we have in modern Greek that comes to us
from antiquity («ανάγκα και θεοί πείθονται»). I then apply it to
matters of everyday life that involve indecision. This is about the
feeling of unease we experience when we are not decisive. In the
process, I explain the importance of committing to tasks that have a
life of their own and require maintenance. I then comment on how
freedom is not just "I can do whatever I want" but also "and I live
with the consequences of my actions." Ultimately, knowing our limits
helps us come down to the practicality of the here-and-now and to
recognise that how we feel about something is a reliable starting
point whenever the indecision we are facing is overwhelming.
