In this ~50-minute video, I reference some of the sayings of Confucius
to comment on the overarching theme of a person's behaviour and
outlook. The comments I make are ultimately what I think about certain
issues: I am not an expert on Confucius or Confucianism and am simply
using the _Analects_ as a way to frame the presentation.

The first big topic is about the distinction of "street smart" versus
"book smart". I explain how the experiences of one's life influence or
condition their perspective. In this context, I introduce the idea of
basic powers, which I mention again in various parts of the video, as
I connect the dots.

The second is the distribution of competences in society and how
people are different. This relates to how some tend to be more
interested in spirituality than others. I note how this is a fact of
life. I explain, in this regard, how elitism is misguided.

The third issue is about personal responsibility and the more general
idea of embodying the change you wish to see. I provide relevant
examples.

The fourth and final point is on giving people what they need, though
not necessarily what they want. I elaborate at length, while drawing
connections to other thoughts I expressed.
