Discipline pertains to one's commitment to reasonableness, where
"reasonableness" consists of a set of principles that guide one's life
in accordance with reason.  Discipline encapsulates the connatural
virtues of honesty, courage, and tenacity, which we may here present as
standalone, analytical constructs though in practice they form part of
an otherwise singular experience.

* Honesty concerns the truthfulness one must have with respect to their
  own principles.  It is about not taking the easy way out, for to cheat
  is to primarily lie to oneself.

* Courage is the disposition of daring to commit to the rigours implied
  by one's values; it is the attitude of not finding excuses to
  introduce ad-hoc exceptions to the principles when those do not
  rectify a state of unreasonableness under particular circumstances; it
  is the driving force of forethought, of preparing oneself for
  experiences yet to be.

* Tenacity describes the modal qualities of such a commitment; a mode of
  conduct that prefers the most appropriate course of action over a more
  convenient one in terms of first appearances, the right thing in the
  long term over what may be expedient at the moment.

To be disciplined is to conduct oneself with consistency: to commit to
the task at all times within the scope of reasonableness.  It is about
setting realisable goals and proceeding to meticulously accomplish them.

Realisability follows from reason, as one must evaluate their condition
on a basis that is equally devoid of self-deprecation and lofty
expectations that are misaligned with one's actuality and potential.
Realisability involves fearlessness to treat oneself with neither
pretences nor defeatism, and it also speaks of ambition as it targets
not just one's current state, with its given horizon of possibilities,
but also the state at which one's potentiality is believed to be
fully reached.

Consistency thus performs a cathartic function of freeing oneself from
falsehoods; falsehoods of who one thinks they are; falsehoods that come
in the form of rationalisations that hamper or misdirect action.  It
further succeeds in setting in motion a sustainable cycle of propitious
growth in capacities to achieve one's objectives that follow from
reason.

Discipline expects knowledge of oneself.  Yet to know who one is
requires an appreciation of the factors that inform the case they are
immersed in, for one exists in a given milieu that involves other
humans, the intersubjective magnitudes between them, such as language
and culture at-large, and everything that is not considered part of the
human world in an analytical sense though is inseparable from it _in
vivo_.  This poses the problem of qualifying object properties
independent of environmental properties, which ultimately dissolve into
interconnectedness.  It also raises questions about the distinction
between human nature and convention and the degree to which it applies.
There is a level of abstraction, a given scope of application, where the
analytical constructs can be held as separate, so that there can be
instantiations of concepts even though those do not have a standalone
presence once the constitution of the case is expanded beyond analytics.

To know oneself introduces an element of approximation of one's
condition.  Such is no perfect knowledge, for one cannot arrive at a
strict objectivity of their subject through their subjectivity.  The
self is a factor of the case and so it exists in a cobweb of feedback
loops with other factors, in that it is part of their grand interplay,
which means that it is involved in cycles of events that influence,
frame, or otherwise condition its state.  As such, one can claim to know
their self only as an idealisation, as that which is considered common
in the multitude of phenomena.  An "idealisation" here means an
abstraction from the particularities but also denotes the simplification
of the case's constitution, where one either purposefully or through the
impossibility of omniscience reduces the case to a subset of its
factors, thus altering at the level of the thinkable its constitution
and the findings that may be derived therefrom.

Consequently, the reasonableness that discipline is committed to is
grounded in practicality, which involves a degree of arbitrariness and
proneness to error.  Couched in those terms, to know oneself is to
maintain an open-minded idea of who one is, remain dubitative and
inquisitive about it, and be prepared to assess new phenomena and
corresponding patterns of behaviour on their own merits.  This suggests
that the self---the conception of self---is dynamic and mutable, even
when changes are marginal or gradual.

Such uncertainty imposes a constraint whose recognition hints at the
sceptical mindset: the ability to withhold judgement without fearing the
resulting uncertainty.  Fear of the unknown is what compels humans to
invent and then enforce answers where none truly exist as a short term
remedy to their uneasiness.  It is what feeds their propensity towards
avoiding open-endedness, for the unknown disturbs the person who has not
yet come to terms with the limitations of their nature, one of which is
the impossibility of omniscience.

To tolerate uncertainty is to escape from the instinctive---sometimes
detrimental, other times benign---fear of the unknown, in order to
control one's presence in a spirit of calmness and tranquillity.  There
is no angst left, only _ataraxia_: the recognition that one does not know
nearly as much as they think they do or would like to and remains calm
about it in a profound sense of living in calmness, neither preaching it
nor pretending to be that way.

Sceptical thinking involves modesty, for one must operate in a manner
that is consistent with open-endedness or, in other words, that does not
introduce dogma: a false sense of certainty that conflates one's opinion
with the truth.  To be modest is to exercise restraint in how one
behaves and thinks, which means that one does not value continuity for
its own sake, as in the sense of showing unbending devotion to the
beliefs one had expressed in the past or the notion of dying for one's
ideas, for those likely assume a certainty that has not been truly
attained.

Discipline thus consists in moderation.  To exaggerate is to introduce
an element of arbitrariness beyond that which is expected by the
impression of the self and the case in the thinkable.  There is a
difference between (i) error that is graspable and rectifiable and (ii)
the terminus to one's faculties of sense and intellect.  To overestimate
one's abilities is another way of misreading the constraints imposed
upon them by the prevailing conditions: an instance of unreasonableness.

Moderation, like the conception of self, cannot be stipulated as static
or immutable.  It cannot be described independent of its contextuality.
And so it too must be discerned through careful deliberation in a spirit
of open-endedness and in accordance with practical reason.  To find the
mean is to remain zetetic and aporetic about the constitution of the
case: it is to continue searching for the truth and be readily aware
that whatever conclusion is an intermediate state between cycles of
research that involve certainty and uncertainty, to the effect that the
truth at any given moment is a reflection of that which is possible by
the given state of knowledge and the way it is interpreted or
implemented.

Searching for the mean in quotidian life, within the mindset of
scepticism, has a potential direct effect on the particularities of
one's principles.  For one's impression of what is reasonable in
scenario A may not be the same in scenario B due to alterations in the
case's constitution.  If one were to mistake discipline for continuity
or devotion to a preconceived, decontextualised cause they would be
committing the error of applying the findings of case A to case B, thus
disregarding the differences between the two and the variations in the
possible phenomena that may emerge from them.

Discipline is commitment to reasonableness to the effect that it cannot
be reduced to a mechanistic pattern or set of unexamined and
unquestionable routines that operate as effective enemies of reason.
Rather, through discipline one must be in a position to evaluate
evolving states of affairs to continuously affirm the reasonableness
that underpins their modus vivendi.  It is the sign of wisdom to know
when to break one's rules and how and, conversely, unflinching faith to
rules of conduct regardless of the prevailing conditions points at
dogmatism, i.e. unreasonable behaviour

Wisdom rests on the understanding of human's fallible nature.  It
recognises that there can be a once-unfathomable-now-revealed
constitution of the case in which what stood to reason before it has
since become alien to reason.  More generally, it admits that
reasonableness is a function of the constitution of the case; a case
that encompasses the subjective magnitude of the agent who assesses the
factors involved, and the objective dimension of those factors in their
interplay, with the understanding that each of those factors can have an
indeterminate behaviour of its own.  Wisdom admits universal
interconnectedness.  To insist on a decontextualised brand of
reasonableness, rules without the requisite environment for their benign
applicability, is a form of recklessness or exaggeration that violates
moderation and ultimately undermines discipline.

A disciplined life covers the totality of one's patterns of behaviour
which have all been subjected to the same rigours of being aligned with
reason and remaining open to revaluation.  In accordance with
practicality, a life of that sort cannot be realised at once.  The
endeavour is impossible for the uninitiated.  A gradual method is in
order, just as how one must be able to jog for 5 minutes, then 10, 30,
and so on, before they can think about competing at a Marathon run.
Again, this is about finding the mean and avoiding excesses by knowing
oneself in light of what is documented herein.

To believe that one may transition to a disciplined life in an instant
constitutes a failure to recognise the demands imposed by conformance
with reason.  Such a feeble attitude hints at irresponsibility: a
frivolous outlook of not trying in earnest to make an accurate estimate
of the requirements and of who one is and, consequently, of not
assigning appropriate value to an outright erroneous set of conclusions.
Irresponsibility is, in this regard, a form of fallacious thinking.

Instead of trying and failing to commit to a disciplined life at once,
one must develop discrete patterns that partake of the ethos of
discipline.  Those are self-contained habits or daily routines that
initiate one into the process of forging the mentality of commitment to
the cause of reason.  They are to be called "rituals": mundane exercises
whose real purpose is to keep one on track.

Rituals must be understood as ancillary to the sceptical disposition of
moderation, not as articles of faith.  They are devices that are
designed to be employed as means to a greater end.  A clear sign of
failure to act reasonably is to misconstrue observance of rituals with
discipline as such, in the same way a statue of Demeter (Earth Mother),
an otherwise poetic encapsulation of a rich narrative, is not Demeter.

[ Read: [On role and actuality](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-04-15-role-actuality/) (2021-04-15) ]

Rituals are to be embedded in one's life in accordance with an
incrementalist method of practising them and becoming better at them
over time.  Incrementalism refers to the approach of performing one
minute change at a time.  Those changes have a compounding effect, as
each increment builds on the previous one until the ritual becomes the
new normal in one's life.

Consider, for example, the act of walking and suppose that one wants to
ritualise it, in the sense here considered, by starting from a state
where a daily walk was not part of their schedule.  Such a person must
begin by trying 5 minute walks around their house, as in the case of
walking down the street and then back home.  This should be done once
per day.  When the person feels confident in their ability to push for a
higher target, the duration can increase to 10 minutes, and then 20 or
even 30.  There can be no exact timetable for determining the precise
timing of increasing the effort estimate.  It depends on each person.
Someone may be able to make progress within a few days, while another
requires a few weeks.  What matters with those rituals is to commit to
the cause, not to compete with another person and certainly not to live
by someone else's standards, for competition is not an end in itself.

A ritual is an exercise in preparation of the real goal of conforming
with reason.  If one can commit to walking for, say, an hour a day, and
of doing the same with other rituals, then they can apply that rigour to
thinking things through, avoiding exaggerations and dogma, and generally
living in accordance with reason, always without prejudice to each
person's abilities.

The incrementalism by which rituals are to be introduced and observed in
daily life helps keep one's expectations in check.  The single most
important aspect in any given routine is how one perceives themselves
making progress in it.  When the expectations are too high, and thus
unrealistic, the resulting feelings are those of disempowerment and
disappointment, which may turn into rationalisations that seek to render
void the significance of discipline, as in the form of "I never wanted
it, anyway".  Exorbitant expectations, which entail unreasonableness,
may also inwardly corrupt the person's frame of mind by tempting them to
cheat, to seek an easy way out, which would result in a failure to pass
the test of honesty.

Incrementalism ensures that one comes to terms with their potential
through their own trials and errors.  It is essential to understand
one's limits and to work within them.  Discipline is not about becoming
an elite performer relative to one's peers, but only to commit to the
reasonableness that is to govern one's life, which necessarily means
that the principles derived therefrom are aligned with one's actuality,
else they would not be reasonable.  This, too, is about managing
expectations: to be true to oneself is to be at peace with who one is.
Conversely, to be untrue to oneself is to be at odds with who one is; a
tension that prevents ataraxia and may well manifest as illness of some
sort.

To manage expectations is to gradually yet steadily refute the lies that
one has accumulated about their conception of self.  The undisciplined
person has no accurate sense of self, but only a false idol that is an
amalgamation of misunderstandings and role-playing or mimetic patterns
of behaviour.  Those are inherently intersubjective in that they pertain
to the formation of one's passive perception of self within their
social-cultural milieu.

To assume a role through sheer inertia is to be aligned with the
expectations of one's peers.  Perhaps this is best understood through
gender stereotypes like "real men don't cry and are fearless", to the
effect that one who is assigned to a gender of those involved must
behave in accordance with the bundle of meanings inherent in the
relevant prejudices in order to verify their gender---and, by extension,
their place among their peers---on a continuous basis.  The same for all
socially-sanctioned exhortations.  The role-playing agent is an avatar
of normativities, whose two-fold function is to validate and amplify
them.

To assume a role in the social milieu is a form of acting, though not
the didactic kind that has cultural value, as in theatre and cinema, but
of being hypocritical by default through maintaining lies and delusions
about who one is.  Hypocrisy runs contrary to the virtue of honesty and
so the person whose disposition is characterised by role-playing cannot
commit to reason, for doing so entails truthfulness to oneself in light
of a sceptical mindset that does, among others, question the adequacy
and truthfulness of such normativities.

A sense of perspective, else moderation, is key to avoiding pernicious
falsehoods: an incrementalist method is required to treat roles as
layered constructs that must be carefully peeled off over time by
observing rituals of discipline.  One cannot just forgo their roles all
at once, for one cannot know in advance who one is about to become.
Recall the open-endedness of the endeavour: to outright suspend roles is
an act of substituting the passively constructed self with a conception
that was formulated prior to exposure to the rigours of practical
reason.

The self cannot ever be fully detached from their milieu, be it the
cultural or the natural, for one cannot have a standalone presence that
derives from nothing.  Subjectivity always remains a factor in the
case's constitution, while one is formed, at least in part, through
exposure to intersubjective magnitudes.  As wisdom admits universal
interconnectedness, it follows that one must be prepared to recognise
that not all roles can be deconstructed, as the micro level of the
person alone cannot affect the emergent phenomena at the macro scale of
their environment, else the structure in which their agency is made
manifest.

Practical reasonableness cannot force one to become absolutely egoistic,
for such is not the human condition.  One cannot know oneself in
isolation, for there is no private, standalone, decontextualised self.
The ego is always contextualised, developed through intersubjectivity as
the sense of self is a function of the case which involves other human
beings and their outright intersubjective phenomena like language and
culture.  Consequently, the connatural virtues of honesty, courage, and
tenacity are not limited to the impression of individuality but are
instead equally applicable intra- and inter- personally.

Discipline is about reasonableness in general.  To recognise the truth
in someone else's conduct is to tacitly admit to a standard or set
thereof by which all relevant actions are measured.  It is the
realisation that one is not the epicentre of the world and that through
shared experiences one learns both about oneself, about their place and
the space in general.

The genuine Olympic Games, not the decadent industry of present day,
were a religious event, else a ritual, in the sense here considered,
whose true intent was to engender this sense of awareness among the
people.  The sports were not about records per se: who is the fastest or
strongest.  Rather, through sportspersonship one would recognise a
certain truth in the other person's performance, while simultaneously
understanding their abilities in relation to that.

To know oneself is to discover the others.  It is only in light of the
whole that the part may develop a sense of place.  And so discipline, a
mode of conduct that involves personal agency, can only ever be rendered
most true when one's milieu is itself characterised by practical
reasonableness, to the effect that the "I" is filtered through the "We",
the latter is understood as emergent from the interplay of all the "I"
and of every factor that informs or has informed them, and all are
treated as inseparable _in vivo_ though they may always be analytically
deconstructed _in vitro_.
