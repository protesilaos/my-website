What does it mean for some thing to exist?

Amidst a bar brawl one of the drunks picks up an empty bottle and hurls
it at the other end of the room.  The object travels in a given
direction at a certain speed.  We can measure those magnitudes.  If the
bottle hits its target, and if that happens to be another fellow, they
feel the impact, experiencing it as pain.  Such a phenomenon can also be
empirically validated.  So we may think that the bottle exists because
we can confirm its presence by relying on our faculties of sense.  Put
differently, we can apply the _principle of correspondence_ to assess
whether an impression maps to some event.

What about notions?  Can we measure those in such a way?  An idea cannot
be thrown at you.  It will not make you bleed.  And so it may not be
measured by using the same method that applies to the flying bottle that
moves through the pub.  Should we then infer that the idea does not
exist?

Let us take a step back and consider a parallel to the example with the
irate drunk tossing bottles around.  Think of a mental stimulus, a
phobia, a trauma, or just a dream.  The thought of something is
sufficient to provide a stimulus which triggers a chain of events in
one's body that are ultimately understood as fear, stress, or some other
emotion.  Words can hurt your feelings.  The sound of an explosion can
send shivers down one's spine who has lived through a certain traumatic
experience.  Some flatterer's compliments can boost your ego and,
indirectly, alter your behaviour.

If an idea can be traced as the cause of a phenomenon, or of a series of
phenomena and their epiphenomena, then we cannot afford to argue that it
does not exist simply because it is intangible; at least "intangible"
when compared to how a bottle is something you can grasp.

What if ideas are patterns of biochemical activity that are interpreted
as meanings, with the latter being functionally equivalent patterns
whose application differs from the former in that they are intended to
be stored in our memory, else form part of our stock of knowledge?  The
"stock of knowledge" may itself be reducible to biological processes
that render their outcome as permanent, the same way a muscle is said to
develop and retain memory.  In a world where matter is a form of energy,
why can't ideas be examined in terms of their _effective materiality_?

While we could employ linguistic means to disambiguate the two types of
existence considered thus far, I am of the view that such an exercise
concerns a secondary classification.  Both are the subject of ontology
and my intent right now is to rethink the analytical framework we have
for _noetic_ (of the mind or intellect) and _empirical_ presences (of
the faculties of sense) rather than directly proceed to delineate and
describe that domain.

What distinguishes beings is their mode [of being], their _tropos_, else
the pattern we associate with them.  Water and ice can be conceived
differently by recognising that one is liquid and the other is solid;
that one is between a certain range of temperatures, while the other is
below that level.  However we go about it, we are essentially discerning
patterns in an otherwise uniform, continuous world where water can be
liquid, or solid, or vapour, or where the elements that constitute water
may be diffused and be fused anew in combination with other elements to
derive other forms of being.

This is not to claim that all that exists is essentially the same.  That
may be the case reductively, though the world as we understand it is not
reductive in its actuality.  The point is to appreciate the importance
of _the pattern_.  That is what matters, in the same way it does in our
common tongue where a given combination of the letters, say, "d" "g" "o"
can be assembled in such a way as to mean "dog" or "god".  Same
constituents, profoundly different concepts as well as diverging
narratives and concomitant significations.

One could posit that ideas have an element of subjectivity to them, a
kind of arbitrariness or indeterminacy which is not present in the
objective world; the world of the bottle ("…. or the dog", adds the
atheist).  The argument would be that ideas are in one's mind and
different people may assign a unique meaning to a superficially common
concept, to the effect that they no longer denote the same 'thing'.
Someone who is a regular at the local pub associates a bottle of their
favourite beverage with socialisation and joy, while another who holds
other values only treats it as a dangerous temptation.  Such
subjectivity must mean that we cannot equate _the notion_ of a bottle
with _the instance_ of one.

Equivalence in what sense though?  Is it in their capacity to be
examined empirically?  Sure, they are not the same in that regard.  Such
is a lateral methodological consideration that may, inter alia, hint at
the inadequacy of the method itself in capturing a given truth.  Perhaps
a one-size-fits-all postulate about methodology is wrong.  How about
equivalence in the sense that both partake of being?  What does that
suggest about our pretences to objectivity or our claims on its extent?

Our notion of the objective world consists of the totality of forms of
being that are impressed upon us in accordance with what is believed to
be the baseline of human faculties of sense and intellect.  In other
words, when everyone sees a bottle, the bottle is believed to be visible
beyond doubt and, by extension, to exist.  How does a bottle render
itself present to someone who lacks sight and who has never touched
neither a bottle nor that particular item that everyone else agrees upon
its presence?  What is the taste of a beverage to whom has never
consumed it or anything of its kind?  How does an experience unlike all
others reveal its secrets to someone who has never gone through it?  And
how can the empirically verifiable traits of a certain object be touted
as indisputably objective when they too are a function of the agent of
the inquiry into their particularities and of the specific method
involved?  In other words, how can you so blithely remove the student
and their instruments from the topic being studied, while insisting that
the latter has a standalone, decontextualised presence?

A decontextualised being can only be conceived as such.  Objectivity of
this sort is the idealised midpoint of common subjectivity that is
peculiar to the human species and, quite likely, to other forms of life,
including animals and plants.  There is no variant of an objective
reality that is not contingent on the subject's nature, the subject's
inherent abilities to experience it, reason about it, and draw
inferences therefrom.

Such insight does not imply that the world is profoundly subjective, in
the sense that it is a manifestation of our mind's inner operations,
whatever such a hypothesis may entail.  Rather, the dichotomy we try to
introduce between noetic and empirical magnitudes is tenuous as it rests
on a tacit medium of interpretation, else judgement, that conceals
itself as a prior truth.  We should be careful not to fall into the
dogmatist's trap of vindicating the categories we already assume as
constant.  This requires us to be mindful of what we mean by
"objectivity" and to apply the dialectical ethos consistently, so that
we remain sceptical of everything, including the adequacy and propriety
of our own endeavours (also read [The Dialectician's
Ethos](https://protesilaos.com/ethos-dialectic) (2020-09-30)).

Notwithstanding any remaining theses on the topic of objectivity and
related epistemology, there is another sense in which we must critically
assess claims on some thing's existence: emergence.  The thought of a
dog brings happiness to its human friend, as does the sight of that same
canine.  Such a form of life is not singular though.  It rather stands
as a system of systems that collectively manifest as the pattern we
interpret as "this dog" or "dog" in general.  The supersystem, which we
also refer to as the "organism", consists of subsystems, each of which
is governed both by the rules of its environment---the supersystem and
its supersystems---as well as its own domain-specific ones.  Each of
those subsystems is itself a supersystem of yet more specialised
subsystems, and so on.

Emergence means that there is a stratum of being that is superjacent to
its contributing or underlying strata.  Such a stratum can more commonly
be understood by approximation, as a domain of application for a given
research programme (also read [Notes on the modes of
Scepticism](https://protesilaos.com/notes-modes-scepticism/)
(2017-07-28)).  For example, a canine trainer only operates at the
stratum of the dog as a whole, while a veterinarian has expertise in the
organs that form part of the specimen's constitution.

The vulgar notion that the dog exists implies that the animal is a unit,
thus ignoring the stratification of emergence here considered.  It is,
in other words, couched in terms of an arbitrary generalisation about
the scope of a certain stratum of emergence (also read [On the
nature-convention
divide](https://protesilaos.com/nature-convention-aromantic/)
(2020-08-10)).  Existence of this sort is associated with a life form,
to the effect that the dog is perceived as a singular entity.  Yet it
can just as well be conceived as a being that emerges from the interplay
between other forms of life.  The emergent _tropos_ of a given dog and
of dog in general, is possible because all those subsystems exist;
though not merely as being present, but rather in a given configuration,
a specific pattern.

To understand this dog or dog in general, we must study the constitution
of each case.  We must be prepared to treat emergence not as the
originator of a life form, but as a stage of modality that defines a
subset of the world, which we choose to treat as a standalone,
decontextualised presence.

If an emergent form of life can exist as the product of a specific set
of interlinked and interlocking operations between subsystems that are,
in such particular case, factors of said emergent stratum, then that
which may derive from the biochemical processes that yield thoughts must
also partake of being.  Matter, else a state of materiality, is but a
tropos, a pattern in an otherwise universally interconnected space (see
[Notes on object and environment
properties](https://protesilaos.com/notes-object-environment-properties/)
(2019-04-23)).

How do we then draw a demarcation line between sheer fantasy and some
scientific hypothesis?  Is it impossible to differentiate a fable from a
historical event, notwithstanding lies that are recorded as facts?  No,
do not panic.  We can still rely on our heuristics for filtering
information and understanding the world around us.  The nuanced take is
not whether some fantasy conforms with the principle of correspondence,
whether it maps to some event that our objectivity can parse, but rather
how such a fantasy can have material implications on a given person or a
group thereof.

Some athlete firmly believes that they are the best in their league.
This unflinching commitment to what may be fantasy, motivates them to
perform at the peak of their powers and to always strive for the best
possible outcome.  Soldiers on the battlefield are indoctrinated into
thinking that they are giving their life for their country, with "their
country" also attaining a possessive sense of owning something, even
though their homeland is nothing more than the fief of some unjust
oligarchy.  Insofar as the motivation itself is concerned or, more
broadly, the effectiveness of an expedient untruth, the principle of
correspondence is not only irrelevant, but outright inappropriate as an
instrument for studying the phenomenon at hand.

The key is to avoid the pitfalls of dogmatism which, in our example,
coincide with naive empiricism or some neighbouring brand of scientism.
Instead of trying to draw lines that mark the borders of what our
current state of conscience wishes to determine as the province of the
intelligible and verifiable, let us adopt an open-ended disposition
towards knowledge and learning (also read [On nihilism, scepticism,
absolutism](https://protesilaos.com/nihilism-scepticism-absolutism/)
(2020-02-29)).  To rethink everything we have hitherto taken for granted
and cast it under a new light.

Are we prepared to step outside our comfort zone?  Do we have the mental
endurance to relentlessly question ourselves and venture into the great
unknown?  Can the understandably fearful animal overcome its fears?
Though not through knowledge, as you may have been conditioned into
believing, but by acknowledging the possibility of not knowing and by
managing to live in peace with that notion.

Tranquillity presupposes humility, abstinence from hubris.
