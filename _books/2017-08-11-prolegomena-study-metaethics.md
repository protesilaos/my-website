1 The abstract structure of a moral theory is the set of foundational or
parametrical ideas that inform, frame, or otherwise define the content
of ethical judgements. That which concerns the general features of all
moral statements—what is common in their multitude—can be treated as a
higher order abstraction: as a form whose instances partake of—and
extend--it.

1.1 The study of the abstract structure of ethics may be referred to as
*metaethics*. It only concerns the foundations, the outlines, or the
framework of a moral theory. Metaethics does not examine ethical
judgements in terms of their content, but only insofar as their formal
features are concerned.

1.1.1 When a certain action occurs, the task of the metaethicist is to
appreciate the factors of the case: that there are situational agents
and patients of a given action. Matters of propriety, or more generally,
the specifics and values involved fall outside the scope of metaethics.

1.1.2 Metaethics is to ethics what metaphysics is to physics. The branch
of philosophy that draws from empirical and then theoretical research in
order to identify the patterns that emerge at a higher order of
abstraction and, subsequently, be in a position to inform the ongoing
research. And, like metaphysics, the philosophical programme has to
remain in sync with findings that are close to immediate experience
backed by scientific validation. Metaphysics cannot replace physics. It
can help the scientist better understand the system within which their
evidence is made manifest. By the same token, metaethics is no
substitute for applied methods, but only a field of study with ancillary
functions. Metaethics helps frame ethical accounts and may thus
contribute to their refinement.

2 The first finding of metaethics is that ethics examines emergent
phenomena. For that is the inference to be drawn from studying actions.

2.1 Action does not occur in a vacuum. There are agents and patients
involved in a certain situation. What happens is a function of all
contributing factors, even if each may contribute to a lesser or greater
extent to the process[es] and the outcome[s].

2.2 Emergence derives from the fact that the entirety of the case cannot
be understood by examining each factor in isolation. Emergence is
realised through the interplay of all elements that constitute the
case. It requires a more macro perspective.

2.3 It is common in philosophy to conduct thought experiments in an
attempt to gain greater conceptual clarity. One such figment is the
decontextualised human, a being *as such*, without reference to its
natural or nominal environment, i.e. to the full array of factors that
contribute or otherwise frame its behaviour and experience.

2.3.1 Where the thought experiment can act contrary to its original
purpose, that is to say when it obfuscates and hides the truth, is
whenever it fails to make ontological references. The decontextualised
human has no *ontic* presence. It is a product of thought that exists
only as an idea—a purely *noetic* presence. Useful in certain ways, but
highly problematic when treated as a general truth and the starting
point of a system of ethics. Whereas an account of a human being that is
consistent with ontology would factor in the natural and nominal
magnitudes germane to its behaviour and experience.

2.3.2 Human is part of nature. It is made of matter. Its biology renders
it subject to the laws of the natural order. Individual attitudes are
heavily determined by natural causes, such as sexual drives being
contingent on the production of hormones. To ignore the natural context
is to arbitrarily exclude a whole range of factors that inform, frame,
or otherwise condition human action and experience.

2.3.3 Similarly, a human being is a political animal. It is immersed in
a given cultural milieu and follows social or collective historical,
economic, and political path dependencies. Behaviours and attitudes,
ideas about the world, social roles and hierarchies, the organisation of
labour and the distribution of resources, are all derived therefrom. We
refer to these magnitudes as *nominal* in juxtaposition to the natural
ones; nominal in the sense that their content is a product of
intersubjective and intergenerational convention.

2.3.3.1 It should be noted that nominality does not entail
arbitrariness. An example from economics is in order. We can all agree
that fiat money, the institution of property rights, the morality of
individualism, the prioritisation of profit, and similar features of
modern capitalism are matters of convention. They are not natural forces
such as gravity or thermodynamics. And the reason is that we can think
of ways to alter them, such as money being a function of some finite
magnitude rather than state edict, property rights not being absolute,
or individualism being replaced by something more holistic such as
ecological thinking. And so, even though we are aware that these are
nominal, what we learn from economics is that the mechanics of their
interplay are objective throughout. Inflation, for instance, is an
emergent—macroeconomic—phenomenon that derives from the individual
actions of economic agents within their micro spheres in accordance with
their risk assessments and the set of incentives or other drivers to
action they are exposed to or determined by. Inflation is a fact with
objectively verifiable properties whose microfoundations are contingent
on nominal values.

2.3.3.2 Put differently, nominality does not suggest relativism or
nihilism. It does not deny the possibility of objective knowledge for
the case at hand.[^NotesScepticism] It only serves as a distinction from
the natural order, as a suggestion that the items concerned are
ultimately contingent on—rather than independent from—human.

2.3.4 Private ethics is immaterial. Action entails externalities. There
has to be an immediate or potential patient, which can imply a change in
their state of being, their behaviour and experience. As such, action of
this sort has qualitative features which can have profound implications.

2.3.4.1 The reason for studying ethics is to identify the appropriate
qualities of action with regard to human's nominal and natural
environments.

2.3.4.2 Ethics is not the only item where a strictly private conception
of it is devoid of an ontological reference point. The same can be
argued for all intersubjective phenomena. For example, there is no
private language. Language is a code of communication. It can only exist
between a sender and a receiver of the message or meaning being
conveyed. Private language in an absolute sense is meaningless.

2.3.4.3 Note that in the specific case of [meta]ethics, the notion of
[inter]subjective is not necessarily denoting individual human
beings. It rather refers more broadly to the subjects of
[meta]ethics. And so, for instance, a society's collective behaviour
towards animals and the environment is, under the scope of these
studies, an intersubjective phenomenon. Understandably, this may not be
the case for all intersubjective phenomena, for some may only be between
humans.

3 A *contextualised* human is understood in two dimensions: (i) as being
a situational agent or patient of a given action, and (ii) as being
framed, conditioned, or determined to a lesser or greater extent by
their natural and nominal environments.

3.1 Free will, conceived in absolute terms as independence from any kind
of determinism or exogenous forces to 'the soul' or 'the mind', has to
be dismissed as an exaggeration drawn from the phenomenality of choice.

3.1.1 What makes the argument for such a free will plausible is a
certain ontological dualism, whereby the soul/mind is treated as an
essence that is somehow transcendent and, thus, immune to the forces
that affect the body. This closely relates to the notion of the
decontextualised human, who enjoys absolute freedom and who can mould
their experience and the world to their liking.

3.1.2 Such exalted being is but a product of myth, fiction, and
tradition that goes unchallenged. What one may do is, at the very least,
dependent on what others enable them to do in present time and what
previous generations provided for through cultural, economic, and
political outcomes; what their starting point in life is such as what
kind of experiences they may be exposed to and what sort of education
they might enjoy; what their available resources are and how these may
be used in their given social milieu; what their biology and natural
surroundings allow for, and so on.

3.1.3 One cannot provide assent to a series of claims about some
ostensibly actual presence—the decontextualised human who exercises free
will—that have no scientific proof whatsoever and which result in an
overly simplistic, ultimately skewed and biased worldview.

3.1.4 What is most likely is that there is no dualism of the sort here
considered. The contextualised human is a biological system with orders
of emergence from the atoms/molecules to the organs and to what is
understood as conscience, with any permutations in between. What human
experiences as freedom to think, choose, act, could be explained as a
dynamic system of probabilistic outcomes. That would be more consistent
with scientific findings about the world—an ontological monism.

3.1.4.1 To each evolving state of affairs a certain realm of possibility
is delineated. That is the [case-dependent] terminus. The phenomenality
of freedom, or else a probabilistic function impressed in the conscience
as freedom, occurs within—and is bound by—it.

3.2 Without absolute free will, there is no equally absolute binary of
reward and punishment. A contextualised human can, at the very best,
only be partially rewarded or punished for a certain action.

3.2.1 Ethical judgements that are couched in terms of a holistic method
must thus go well beyond the study of the mere actions or outcomes
thereof of an individual. At first, the situational agent or patient is
not necessarily a person. It may be a group of people, a legal person,
an entire generation, or even humankind as a whole. As for the
situational patient, it may just as well be a potential presence—a
future being—or a non-human entity, an animal, an ecosystem, or even the
environment at-large.

3.2.1.1 As an example of an agent that is not an individual, think about
the moral outlook of a company that specialises in agriculture. The
company must not only conform with the appropriate standards for food
production, but must also ensure the sustainability of the environment
in which it operates, which should include, among others, the
preservation of any animal species and the resulting
ecosystem. Conforming to food safety measures, implies a responsibility
towards the community of consumers. Ensuring sustainability suggests a
duty towards future generations that could still use the land (which
itself depends on its ecosystem) and/or cohabit with the other species.

3.2.1.2 Sustainability is a key concept in understanding a couple of
magnitudes: (i) the intergenerational nature of emergence when it comes
to action, which can span an extended period of time and, thus, affect
present and potential actors, and (ii) the non-individualistic,
non-anthropocentric conception of the agents and patients of action.

3.2.2 The reward-punishment binary collapses into itself when the
situational agent and patient is no longer limited to the individual who
exercises absolute free will. A more appropriate reformulation is along
the lines of conditions that either enable or disable [potential] states
of affairs, possibly in various combinations. What happens is thus bound
by a realm of possibility that follows certain path dependencies. There
is a history to behaviour, experience, action and its outcomes.

4 Matters of moral agency which entail responsibility must be defined in
accordance with the situational agent's *role*. For contextualisation of
the sort here considered implies access to resources that enable types
of action, behaviour, experience.

4.1 There are orders of abstraction within which the notion of role
applies to different entities. Each set of conditions that enable or
disable [potential] states of affairs is commensurate with the order of
abstraction closest to the relevant entity.

4.1.1 For instance, the question *"what can one do to tackle
inequality?"* entails different courses of action for an individual
citizen, for an assembly of people, for the national government, for
international communities, for the global order. No answer can be
uniform. It can only be in relation to the agent and who the possible
patients of the action may be.

4.1.2 We appreciate that role has differing types and/or degrees of
implication, such as the policies of the government having a more
profound intergenerational impact than those of a microeconomic agent in
an isolated event.

4.2 The concept of role suggests at least the following: (i) ethics has
a clear political dimension, or is otherwise inextricably linked to
politics, (ii) there can be impersonal moral agencies such as the state
or the international community, (iii) the gravity, severity, scope, and
potential ramifications of an intersubjective phenomenon are a function
of the agent's role and, therefore, cannot be examined without reference
to it, (iv) the decontextualised human is, by definition, an entity with
no role for there is no environing whole to it that frames its behaviour
and experience, and so, it is yet again found as a largely inadequate
concept, (v) the greater a subject's access to resources that open up
new frontiers of possibility for an ever increasing array of actions,
the higher the likelihood that the effects will be felt by both actual
and potential patients, implying greater responsibility, (vi) an agent
may be cast in a certain role despite their 'free will' whereby their
expected behaviour is in accordance with their position in the case, not
their own devices, aspirations, beliefs.

5 Metaethics can bring attention to hitherto understudied or altogether
ignored and presumed as self-evident issues. From the emergent nature of
ethics, to the need for overcoming the chimera of the decontextualised
human who exercises absolute free will, to the broadening of moral
reasoning beyond the narrow confines of the individual, to the expanded
understanding of temporality whereby the outcomes of certain actions may
only be truly felt by potential patients, to a point where the binary of
reward-punishment gives way to a spectrum of possible states of affairs
that are either enabled or disabled in various combinations, and to a
new ethics where the role of the contextualised agent is paramount in
appreciating both the scale of the action as well as the ramifications
of any possible outcomes.
