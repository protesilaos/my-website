title: "Why it is not just about you"
subtitle: "On expectations, hubris, and idolatry"
excerpt: "A work on philosophy by Protesilaos Stavrou about expectations, hubris, and idolatry."
---

**A.:** It is a pleasure to have a drink with you.  Such a rare occasion
this is.  Once every two years.  Two years!  I guess I should count it
as a privilege, given that you seldom accept such invitations.  Why did
you join me?

**B.:** You do not expect me to conform with some standard I do not
value, so there is no pressure.  That always makes things easier.  Also
because I heard you have a surplus of money and are desperate to get rid
of it by footing the bill.

**A.:** Sure.  How about a gin-n-tonic?  I noticed the gentleman on that
table ordering one earlier and was reminded how much I like it.  A
refreshing beverage for the evening.  I'm just tired of ales and wines.

**B.:** I used to drink spirits neat.  No ice, no gimmicks.  As well as
beers of all sorts.  Long drinks were never my thing.  Though I have
since quit drinking alcohol.  It is a bad habit that does not contribute
to sociability or fun.  If you absolutely need to imbibe a toxin to
enjoy the night out, you sure have not considered your particular
condition and the social context that enables and encourages it.  But I
digress.  Normally I would get some water, but I'll have a herbal tea
instead.

**A.:** Very well!  I changed my mind and will have one too.  Wait!  Do
you know they make a concoction with ginger, cinnamon, white pepper, and
a slice of lemon?  I find it subtle and relaxing.

**B.:** A concoction does sound ominous, though I am brave enough to
give it a try.  So how are you?  I have not seen you in four months.
When was it?  May?  You look fabulous, as always, though now I sense
that you are happier and less stressed than before.

**A.:** I have been taking yoga classes.  I'm just a beginner so I
probably am not the right person to communicate how special the
experience is.  It has helped me regain confidence in myself.  I have
managed to control my emotions and be more aware of the triggers of
negative reactions.  I am still learning and am happy to stick to it for
the long term.

**B.:** No worries about not knowing the secrets of the yoga teachings
from day one.  It is normal.  I do not know much about them either,
certainly less than you do, and would thus refrain from judging them.
What matters now is the noticeable benign effect it has had on you.

**A.:** Yes, it did.  I have been able to disentangle all those false
wants and aspirations that were burdening me.  I was told that you have
talked about those issues before, but I never paid much attention.
Maybe you even told me directly, but I was too ignorant to listen.  I
only understood after the fact.  Apologies!

**B.:** There is no need.  It is not like my musings are mandatory
reading material for us to share a moment like this.  Though thinking
about it, I need to refine my trolling skills.  I shall compile a list
of publications, preferably comprising the longest or most difficult
ones, and use it as an auto-reply to anyone who invites me to their
party.  There must be no better repellent than asking people for their
opinions as a precondition for responding to their calls!

**A.:** Haha!  You told me already.  I feel you.  I am not much of a
party animal either, though I clearly am people-oriented.

**B.:** It probably has more to do with interests than personality
traits.  I am fine with people.  What I dislike is hypocrisy.  But
anyway.  What else have you been up to?

you](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-06-05-why-you-never-call-me/)
(2021-06-05) ]

**A.:** I met my partner at those classes.

**B.:** Those lucky yogis!

**A.:** And you?

**B.:** I have not been taking yoga classes.

**A.:** Ha, that witty humour of yours!  You probably are the last
person I know who needs them, anyway.  You are always composed.  Do you
meditate, perchance?  Or, more generally, does philosophy involve some
method of achieving mindfulness?

**B.:** I don't meditate and no, philosophy is not a single school of
thought and does not have a defined corpus of guidelines on what to do
with your life.  I do not apply any particular techniques for
mindfulness because I already think about what I do and experience.
This might sound pretentious, but it is the case.  It is part of my
actuality.  Just like you being tall and good looking at all times:
there is not much you have to do to achieve that.  I do enjoy quietude
though and the best way to be in that state in this city is to go for
long walks, because not even the most eager folks will join me.

**A.:** I can see how walking is helping you relax.  It is a physically
demanding task when you cover long distances at a decent pace.

**B.:** It can be.  That is part of the joy: you get to exercise and
also explore the area.  I may already know every corner of this place.

you](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-06-16-no-date-with-you/)
(2021-06-16) ]

**A.:** Does quietude help you be creative?

**B.:** It depends on how we want to approach this.  In a practical
sense, you can only ever express your creativity by being left alone.
Imagine trying to write an essay while having someone over your head
speak the whole time.  It will hinder your efforts.  Then we have the
fact that the act of walking is a time of reflection rather than
production of some defined output.  In that regard, it contributes to
creativity indirectly.  It is a process of fermentation where all sorts
of ideas pop up until they must go through a process of refinement or
distillation.

**A.:** Still, you are so calm.  How do you manage to do that?

**B.:** It was not always the case.  It is a skill you must acquire
which helps you come to terms with who you are and with what you can do.
I remain tranquil by not setting goals that are beyond my reach.  This
presupposes introspection to determine what my capabilities are.  It
also requires assessing the prevailing conditions and envisaging the
possible outcomes.  I find that we are stressed whenever we sense a
mismatch between what we can do and what is expected of us to do in the
predicament we are in.  Sometimes that feeling is unfounded because we
are not aware of our potential, such as when we get anxious about an
exam only to pass it with flying colours.  I would attribute that to a
lack of introspection or inaccurate findings derived therefrom.  In
general though, once we have become more aware of our condition and our
surroundings in order to effectively filter out the false positives,
disturbances are typically traced back to misplaced expectations.

[ Read: [Why you can't upset
me](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-07-08-no-upset/) (2021-07-08) ]

**A.:** I am aware of your thoughts on social pressure, role playing,
and expectations, as well as the agent-structure divide in light of
those.  Let's not retread those paths and consider other cases.  What if
something bad happens which is outside our control?  Suppose you have no
ambitious targets and do not set yourself up for failure that way.  Then
tragedy strikes and you lose a loved one.  Do you remain calm?

**B.:** To be sad about it is understandable, if that is what you are
asking.  Though to be deeply disturbed in a seemingly irreparable way
hints at a conflict with an unrealistic belief in permanence.  You and
your loved ones will not live forever.  If you think otherwise, if you
hope for things to remain constant, you are still setting yourself up
for a major disappointment.  Everything we experience is transient.

**A.:** How do you react in such a case?

**B.:** By being honest to yourself, which entails acceptance of your
sorrow.  Express it.  Don't try to act tough or indifferent or whatever
is supposed to be appropriate for you, for that is a social construct
that is not consistent with your underlying condition at the moment.  It
will harm you more.  There is no point in pretending to remain undaunted
by what is happening around you and, by extension, to you.  The key is
to refrain from clinging on to falsehoods.  If, in this case, you do not
accept the perishable nature of forms of being, you are simply
entertaining a false belief.  When the moment of truth comes, you will
not be prepared for it.

**A.:** Is it possible to not harbour sadness?

**B.:** If by that you mean whether it is feasible to remain insulated
from external stimuli, I think that is a misguided and presumptuous
approach.  Humans, just like all forms of being do not have a
standalone, decontextualised presence.  There is a world that frames,
informs, or otherwise conditions our existence as such, as well as its
modal qualities: the fact that we are and of how we are.  This world is
a system of systems, arranged in strata of emergence, else orders of
abstraction, with rules that are local to each system in addition to
stratum-wide magnitudes.  A system is an interplay of factors, meaning
that there are feedback loops between them within a field of
application.  A factor can be an atom, in the original sense of
conceptual non-divisibility, not the misnomer of physicists, or it can
be a subsystem whose emergent product operates as a factor in its
interplay with other such factors at a higher order of emergence.  In
this grand interconnectedness, the unfolding and dynamic feedback loops
can be understood as a code of communication, in the sense that actions
and reactions lead to highly complex outcomes by triggering a variety of
chains of events.  When you think in those terms, you no longer consider
only the micro level of elements in light of a given consideration but
also the macro perspective in which those elements form discreet
patterns.  It is the pattern that matters, for it carries meaning, just
like how an arrangement of the same letters in our alphabet can yield
dissimilar concepts, as in "dog" and "god".  Same glyphs, different
patterns, distinct meanings, and thus varied reactions and
possibilities.  The idea that the human being as such, or the subsystems
that comprise what we consider the supersystem of the human organism,
can withdraw from the ever-evolving spectrum of probabilities that this
cosmic language which binds everything together enables, is simply
mistaken.

**A.:** Okay, I need to unpack this.  Do you think there is something we
can do to stop being affected by what is happening around us?

**B.:** I have already answered your question, but I will do it again in
plain terms: no, you cannot escape from the cosmos.  You may have heard
stories of people who have stabbed their own eyes so that they may stop
seeing something disturbing.  And, I suppose, that same belief could be
applied to the other senses.  What is the point?  There has to be some
presumption which underpins this sort of behaviour.  Something that
assigns value to it.  Tell me, why do you want to remain unaffected by
all that environs you?

**A.:** We are just entertaining an idea now.  Because let's say it
makes me suffer.  Job requirements, etiquette, social pressure...
Everything.  You covered that before.

**B.:** And as I noted before, you can free yourself from that suffering
when you stop caring about it and by making a conscious effort to put an
end to the role-playing games you find yourself in.  That might entail
difficult decisions, such as quitting a promising career where everyone
calls you a genius and expects you to be the best performer.  It may
mean that you have to let go of the people you consider your friends: if
their conduct pressures you, they are no friends of yours.  Same with
relatives: if they do not want to understand and continue to push you
around, a "fuck off" will usually do the trick.  In short, you have to
break the mould you were cast in.  Though beware of what you ask: what
you may get will not be better by society's standards, as you will be
impoverished and marginalised.  You must take the time to contemplate
whether you are prepared to make a leap of faith into the unknown: do
you want to stop suffering or do you want to conform with whatever
conditions your milieu establishes?  Don't answer, since this is the
figurative "you".  Just something to think about.

**A.:** I see.

**B.:** While you can spend as much time as you need on that point, let
us reconsider your tacit proposition.  That there is a means by which
someone can transcend the boundaries imposed upon them by their nature.
Have you had something like that in mind or did I misunderstand you?

**A.:** Well, I am not clear about it and was merely tagging along to
listen to what you have to say.  Basically you hear about people who
achieve enlightenment and are liberated from this world.  Perhaps you
have an idea of what we can do about it.

**B.:** The notion of liberation from the world presupposes a
proposition that treats the current condition as one of captivity of
some sort.  For example, some think that we fell here because of a
mistake by an original human and that this world serves as an elaborate
test of our capacity to return to where we belong.  Others say that we
are trapped in a cycle of reincarnation and that only through
enlightened non-commitment to this world we will free ourselves from it.
There is a pattern there of a fall and an ascendance, with what we
experience in-between serving as the substitute of a putative true locus
of our presence: this is claimed to be a place we should not really
like.  Can such propositions be objectively verified?  Or are they taken
for granted through the power of tradition and the centuries of cultural
works built upon them?  Make no mistake, we can still draw lots of
useful insights even from unverifiable claims.  Though my point here is
that we need to be careful with normativity that acquires a universal
scope.

**A.:** You mean that we should refrain from making value judgements
about everything?

**B.:** Some wish to draw a distinction between ethics and morality.  I
won't engage in such a pedantic exercise, because it does not matter for
our case.  The terms are interchangeable.  Morality is a human
invention.  A system of rules that governs the behaviour of people,
regulating the roles of situational agents and patients to actions.  In
its literal sense, ethics moulds the character of people, though not the
biological and epigenetic but the intersubjective one.  Ethos, this
moral or intersubjective character, is a decisively political construct.
There are no ethics without politics, for humans institute those rules
together with the overall organisation of their society.  There is no
social organisation without concomitant value judgements.  Put
differently, every political system is underpinned by a certain morality
and when you say that you do not like what is happening on our planet,
you should be prepared to challenge the underlying values that both
reproduce those states of affairs as well as make them seem appropriate
and inevitable.  Furthermore, politics is not just about the formal
political process, as in the day-to-day workings of the state and
everything that goes into its governance, but the activity of
distributing power within an organisation.  As such, it is common to
have corporate ethics because a corporation is, within its own confines,
a political structure where some people exercise control over others.

**A.:** So morality or ethics are clearly human artefacts which we use
for practical purposes.  This does not answer my last question: should
we refrain from making totalising value judgements?

**B.:** Humans are imperfect.  The rules they come up with can be no
different because they do not cover all possible cases and contain
hidden assumptions.  If a moral system is meant to have universal
application, then that will inevitably lead to absurdities.  Take, for
example, the claim that we should not eat animals because they are
alive.  Why eat plants then, for they too are alive?  Why eat anything
for that matter?  Why clean up your room or apply sanitisers and risk
killing billions of microorganisms?  The moment you try to universalise
a moral rule, you commit the error of misrepresenting human invention as
a universal constant.  Put simply, you want to play god while lacking
omniscience.  The issue with all codes of morality is that we cannot
establish objective benchmarks with which to compare and assess them and
cannot always be precise with how to go about performing such a task.
How do we decide what the correct standpoint is and where the lines
should be drawn?  For each evaluation depends on our perspective and on
what we have tacitly considered more valuable than its alternatives.
Which brings us back to the point that ethics are a part of politics, as
they rest on an agreement between people: they are conventional.
Protagoras said that human is the measure of all _chrēmata_ (χρήματα),
which is perennially mistranslated as "things" or what would be called
_pragmata_ (πράγματα).  That error makes the philosopher sound like an
idiot.  What Protagoras meant is that we are the ones who determine the
evaluation of everything that is in use by us.  The value of conventions
is extrinsic, contingent on the circumstances.

Rules](https://protesilaos.com/books/2020-07-01-notes-on-rules/)
(2020-07-01) ]

**A.:** I see.  How do we deal with uncertainty then?

**B.:** By recognising it and operating with it in mind.  Let's take a
short detour here.  The ancient Greeks were polytheists.  Their numerous
gods captured a particular archetype or symbolised some set of values.
Yet they also recognised the concept of the unknown god, which was later
misconstrued as the god of another religion, when in truth it was a
token of this innate doubt that is part of our life.  We do not need to
be polytheists or indeed theists to notice that we live in doubt, we
conduct science in doubt, we theologise in doubt.  There is no human
design which is genuinely totalising and absolutely certain.  When we no
longer accept the possibility of an unknown god, else uncertainty, in
our worldview, we commit the error of not recognising our limits as
human beings, as the fallible and imperfect animals that we are.  The
word for that kind of arrogance, for that misplaced sense of
exceptionalism, is _hubris_.  To act recklessly by driving a motorcycle
at full speed on a wet road while not wearing a helmet is hubris: you
will die if you have an accident, even though in the moment you consider
yourself a badass and immortal.  To think that you are all-knowing is
hubris, and you will suffer the consequences of your insolence just like
in the story of Victor Frankenstein.  To procrastinate all day and then
search for motivational articles, life hacks, or ostensible cheat codes
that open a direct conduit to wisdom is hubris, because you fail to
admit that expertise is acquired only through longer-term commitment.
You get the idea.  This is not to say that we should not theorise about
the world or have morality or conduct experiments or try new things just
because we cannot have absolute certainty.  Only that we need to remain
grounded by understanding the all too human aspect of our schemes, the
possibility of thinking of them anew, and have an escape plan for when
our overly ambitious course of action leads to failure.

**A.:** It is all a matter of proportion then.  To find the balance
intuitively.

**B.:** Indeed.  We got into this topic by questioning the claim of some
schools of thought, religious or otherwise, that we can effectively
escape from the world.  You assumed that would be possible, presumably
because you hear about it a lot and took it for granted.

**A.:** Well, I feel there is at least some truth to being more
spiritual.  If each of us turns into their self and reflects carefully,
we can become more compassionate and align ourselves with nature.  Love
will save us all.

**B.:** I think being spiritual is different from what I have been
referring to.  Getting closer to nature is laudable, though I will
explain what I mean a bit later.  Keep that in mind.  And love can be an
effective medium for enacting reform.  Though you must take a step back
and think about whether you are speaking about nature or the idol of
nature.

**A.:** I am not sure I understand.  I mean that we will turn towards
Gaia and become loving beings.  That will solve a lot of problems.

**B.:** My thesis is that nature must include every facet of life, not
just love.  In nature we have conflict, competition, struggle for
survival, love as a means of enhanced cooperation within nuclei of
social species to out-perform their opponents...  When the wolf kills
its game, it is not operating in a binary of compassion versus hatred,
good against evil.  Those are human categories.  Nature just is.  Its
facts do not have a moral value.  It is meaningless to claim that it is
good to sleep, because we cannot afford to do otherwise.  Recall that
morality is a system of rules that regulate the modes of interaction
between situational agents and patients to a given action.  We are in
control of chrēmata, not pragmata.  Morality builds an intersubjective
character.  For those rules to make sense, they have to be actionable
and that involves agency, else the capacity to recognise those patterns
in the structure and adapt to them.

(away)](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-07-19-walking-away/)
(2021-07-19) ]

**A.:** So you are arguing that equating nature with love leads us to
the idolisation of what we are considering?

**B.:** Yes, and here I will introduce another misunderstood term:
idolatry.  The early Christians used that word to slander pagans on the
premise that a statue of a god cannot be a god.  Fair enough!  Yet
idolatry follows from a tendency to idealise and then to mistake the
ideal with the actual while appraising it.  It is not a particular
historical feature of the Roman paganus.  Today we have idolatry
everywhere in a variety of forms.  Christians have idolatry, such as by
considering certain icons themselves as miraculous.  Consumers are
idolaters whenever a mere gadget or commodity becomes a symbol of social
status, a bragging right, the basis of some elitism.  Political
activists are engaging in idolatry when they indignantly harass a public
figure on a social media platform for not conforming with some
impossible moral standard.  Our role-playing games in society and how
social expectations are developed also involve idolisation.  In all such
cases we have idols acting as substitutes for---or de facto enemies
of---what they intend to symbolise.  The exalted image of the underlying
form assumes a life of its own through the narratives that are
associated with it.  Nature is another such idol where all our talk
about it tends to reflect our projected views, such as Gaia being
all-loving, simply because we have developed this idea of universal,
i.e. totalising, love and went too far with it.  Think of it this way:
the difference between medicine and poison is one of degree.  Put some
vinegar in your salad and enjoy the health benefits.  Drink a litre of
vinegar and you will be sent directly to the hospital as a matter of
utmost emergency.  It is about the balance you mentioned earlier.

**A.:** Are we misrepresenting nature to feel good about ourselves or to
justify what we do?  Is love not the answer?

**B.:** To idolise is not out of the ordinary.  I would speculate that
it is prevalent in all human societies.  In this case though, hubris
consists in not recognising the possibility that we may become victims
of our propensity for idolisation.  The reasons why some may be
depicting nature in a certain way are likely to be variegated: we cannot
know what motivates each person or group.  To answer that kind of
question we must delve into the specifics, which we have no means of
doing right now.  Suffice to say that idealisation which effectively
takes the stead of reality will prove problematic once it is confronted
with that which it had omitted from its representation of the subject
matter.  This applies to the totalising preaching of unilateral love.

**A.:** Love is kind of the wrong goal then?

**B.:** Love itself is fine.  Same with the example I provided earlier
about not eating animals.  It is the totalisation of love or every
principle which is dubious, because nature includes other forces as
well.  Why choose to ignore or discount them?  That aside, I think this
theory gains force in a socio-economic milieu of privilege or relative
security.  It is a luxury to think that you can just turn inwardly,
ignore the world around you, and through compassion alone make things
happen.  For you to be able to engage in that kind of activity in peace,
there has to be a political system in place which tolerates it, at the
very least.  It cannot happen unilaterally.  You are taking too many
things for granted if you think that doing your own thing has no
prerequisites.  In concrete terms, do you think you will rely on nothing
but positive vibes in the face of an omnipotent totalitarian regime bent
on obliterating you?  What about exercising caution and cunning to
protect yourself from tyranny?

**A.:** Is there no point in focusing on our selves?  If everyone
becomes a better person, then there will be nothing to worry about.  I
guess that is the lesson to be drawn.

**B.:** It is plausible, though unlikely because it rests on a
coincidence of attitudes across a heterogeneous set of people.  We have
had thousands of years of history to be confident in the view that
converting everyone, either through peace or with fire and steel, to a
religion whose banal morality is all about love has had a negligible
effect on the overall justice of the order we live in.  And that is
because there is a distinction to be made between actual societies and
clubs.  The former develop organically and remain heterogeneous in terms
of the availability of talents and abilities.  Whereas the latter has
selection bias built into it and is, therefore, more likely to pass a
particular test for which it is optimised for.

**A.:** Care to elaborate on the club metaphor?

**B.:** Imagine the creation of a small community in some remote place
out of a gathering of the world's leading pacifist intellectuals.  That
will most likely end up being a success story of peaceful co-habitation,
because the members of the community all share similar views, they all
have a high intelligence and can reason about their common issues given
they are intellectuals, and so on.  Now what happens to such a wonderful
bunch once we introduce real-world influences to it, such as migration
from countries where no pacifists exist?  Or when there are threats of
war from regimes that are not amused by our little all-singing,
all-dancing community.  Do the pacifists try to fend for themselves?
Are existential threats a _casus belli_?  Do they maintain borders to
impede the migratory influx of non-pacifists, as newcomers with that
background would refashion the character of their social bond?  My point
is that when people are in a position of privilege they have the luxury
to fancy their life in black-and-white terms where they choose the side
of the good.  When, however, you introduce friction, you start realising
that the absolutes are untenable.

**A.:** Love is not the answer to everything then...

**B.:** It is only if you accept the dogma that this world is our prison
cell and the only escape is through a particular morality.  I have not
been persuaded by those claims and, as such, cannot accept their
derivatives at face value.  Instead, I choose to rely on common sense.
If a bully enslaves and abuses a child or a wild animal, does the hatred
or repulsion you feel for that injustice motivate you to act against it?
If so, then hatred or repulsion is vitalising a certain force for
justice, understood as the abolition of the arbitrariness of control
imposed by the abuser against the victim.  Now you may want to re-frame
that scenario as being about showing love towards the victim, though my
focus is on the feeling of non-love towards the abuser, however we may
call it.  At any rate, those same sentiments cannot always have the same
effect, for obvious reasons.  Sometimes love is what propels us to those
heights.  Hence the need for common sense.  Think about the exhortation
to never lie and suppose you find yourself in a life threatening
situation, just like Odysseus (Ulysses) who was trapped in the cave of
the Cyclops.  Will you speak the truth and die or act with cunning to
return to your long journey back home?  And remember that I doubt the
presence of a global scoreboard that measures our performance to
determine whether we will ascend into another domain or not.  It may be
fascinating to think you are too smart to apply common sense and will
instead search for some intricate method reserved for a self-righteous
elite.  I am just the common sense type and think we must assess the
particularities of the case and determine whether some means can lead to
certain ends, always with the proviso that morality is a human
convention.

**A.:** This common sense can also be explained as not having
preconceived notions?

**B.:** What I have in mind is the disposition of remaining dubitative
and inquisitive in the face of evolving events.  To inquire upon the
specifics of the case is to approach the issue with no bias or, at
least, with no intent of being prejudiced.  Your quest is to identify
the truth, not uncritically conform with the guidelines of elders or
whomever.  Finding a balance is helpful just like with the
medicine-poison comparison.  Which brings me to this idea of aligning
oneself with nature...

**A.:** Ah yes, I mentioned that earlier...

[ Read: [On materiality and
emergence](https://protesilaos.com/books/2020-12-20-emergence-materiality/)
(2020-12-20) ]

**B.:** We do not have a definitive understanding of nature and are thus
prone to idolisations.  On the one hand, to determine the specifics of
the case is to describe that which is and, we hold, nature is.  So the
quest for approximating the truth must be, in a manner of speaking, the
attempt to get closer to nature by setting aside our falsehoods to
behold what truly is.  On the other hand, we have established that
nature contains all possible states, such as love and hatred, to the
extent that it must be natural to fantasise and, consequently, idealise
and idolise.  We cannot rule those out as unnatural, for where do they
come from?  Recall that humans do not have a decontextualised presence
and thus cannot generate all the negatives in the world out of their own
free will, as that vaunted concept requires a standalone existence (yes,
I am a free will sceptic).  As such, we count them as natural.  But we
have to somehow be able to distinguish the actual from the imaginary,
even though that which is in our fantasy is fundamentally possible just
like everything else in nature.  What we do, essentially, is employ
heuristics with which to establish a modicum of objectivity and
determine the correspondence between the thought of something and its
instantiation.  Science, or philosophy, or jurisprudence and morality,
are works-in-progress in which we basically proceed through trial and
error until we get the best results in the moment.  Sometimes we stumble
across patterns in the cosmos that occur regularly and we are able to
define those with greater precision than others which leave a lot of
room for interpretation.  Whatever we do, we must consider the
possibility of inadvertently making an idol out of our subject matter
and committing hubris in the process by thinking we know more than we
actually do.

**A.:** Is there some practical insight we can derive from this?

**B.:** Take social role-playing.  You already know how your sexual
orientation was at conflict with the gender that was assigned to you at
birth.

**A.:** Yes, I do and have had a lot of trouble in my life.  It still is
a challenge.  Though I am calm now as I have learnt to live without
their validation.

**B.:** Good!  What was at play, what always beset you from all sides,
were social expectations of conforming with a given normal.  The
normativity of being that particular type of human and of having to
behave in that specific set of ways.  They told you that it is not
natural to look like one but feel like the other and you got depressed
because deep down you understood that you did nothing wrong as you were
that way naturally.  Now we know those prejudices to be predicated on an
idolisation of nature, not an assessment of nature proper.  They had
created an effigy of nature in their mind which could, at its best, be
representative of the state of the heuristics of yesteryear.  We could
say that they did not know any better and the simulacrum of nature they
produced was the best they could achieve back then, which is not a
problem in itself.  The problem consists in the hubris of treating
heuristics as tantamount to the eternal truth, of conflating the idol
with the deity it is meant to symbolise.  If those people knew that
their view of nature was "their view" and that it was not nature as
such, then they would be better prepared to take a deep breath and
reconsider their beliefs.

**A.:** I see.  The hubris of being prejudiced when they should have
been sceptical of their own position and should have applied common
sense when their theories proved inadequate to describe the phenomena in
front of them.  This makes me confident that I can withstand the
pressure more effectively.  They are basically ignorant.  Thank you!

**B.:** You are welcome!  And thanks for the drink and the quality time
we spent here.

**A.:** Likewise.  Hopefully the next time will not be in two or more
years from now.

**B.:** Maybe it will be sooner.  Or it may never happen again.
Impermanence and all that.

**A.:** Sigh... And what about the spirit.  Should we commit to it?

**B.:** We are fully fledged human beings.  Have you ever had a drink
with a spirit?  There are several aspects to our existence: physical,
mental, intellectual, aesthetic, and mystical.  As with the world
at-large, they are connected.  You cannot just have one.

**A.:** Which is the greatest error humans commit?

**B.:** Hmm... To mistake chrēmata for pragmata.

**A.:** And the second?

**B.:** Oh, this is getting tricky.  And I'm not even drunk!  Perhaps
their tendency to idealise becoming a fraction of themselves.  One
wishes to become just a spiritual being.  The other aspires to be only
physically fit.  A third valorises their rationality and considers
everything else to be nonsense.  Again, there has to be a balance, a
sense of proportionality.  It is like listening to only one tune for the
rest of your life.  You cannot sustain it, even if it is your favourite
song.  Sometimes you need the therapeutic energy of Istvan Sky or the
raw power of Kawir.  Other times you want to explore the alien
soundscapes of Atra Aeterna.  And others, still, you accept an
invitation to attend a live concert of The Van Jets.
