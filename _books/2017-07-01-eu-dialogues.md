## Introduction

With this publication—*Dialogues on EU politics*—I have tried to convey
ideas in a dialogical format. The book explores some of the common
themes in the European integration process, while delving into political
theory and philosophy when necessary. Some notable topics include:

- what binds together the EU polity;
- the EU as a federation;
- the EU as a republic;
- Europe's differentiated integration;
- the propriety of referenda in modern democracy;
- whether neoliberalism is inherent to the euro/EU.

These are complemented by theoretical insights on politics as well as on
method, such as:

- the meaning of democracy with fundamental rights and the rule of law;
- the distinction between primary law and the constitution;
- the scopes of sovereignty and its emergent nature;
- the notion of "democratic sovereignty";
- the incrementalism of EU policy caused by the gradualism of European
  integration;
- the disaggregation of the subjects of inquiry.

On the level of communicating ideas, I find the dialogue to be a very
powerful and didactic tool. It has a certain flow to it that make it
easier to follow. Ultimately though, this is an experiment. Whether the
rigid structure of the essay can be replaced by a method of analysis
that is equally effective yet more intuitive.

These are fictional discussions between friends. The setting is a bar or
a cafeteria that serves alcoholic beverages. I have personally had some
of the most rewarding debates in that kind of environment, hence the
choice.

This is a short book. It is meant to complement the work I do on my [EU
politics blog](https://protesilaos.com/blog/), and everything I have
written over time in the [books section](https://protesilaos.com/books/)
of my website. It rephrases old ideas of mine while introducing some new
ones.

As for the presentation of the *Dialogues*, it is a web-based
publication that *looks* exactly like a series of blog posts. I publish
in a native web format, because I find it technically superior to other
alternatives such as `.pdf` files. These pages are indexable, can be
read on any device that can browse the Internet, and are highly
portable: easy to copy and reuse, easy to migrate to another database,
etc. I do, nonetheless, provide a single page view, the [print
section](https://protesilaos.com/eudi/print/). This is meant to serve
readers who would rather keep physical copies.

Finally, the *Dialogues on EU politics* is distributed free of charge

## On the homogeneity of the European polity

**Artur.** This is one of the finest ales I have ever tasted. Belgian,
right?

**Beata.** Yes, it comes from an area near Brussels. Top quality
product. Of course, the cost here is higher than in Belgium. We have to
cover transportation fees. At least though we do not need to worry about
tariffs and similar impediments to trade.

**A.** You can thank the EU for that. Cheers!

**B.** Well, yes and no. The idea of the single market is not specific
to the European Union. The EU was established in the 1990s. The single
market started out in the 1950s with the European Economic
Community. The EEC only wanted to create a trade block out of its member
countries. An area for free trade, without arbitrary restrictions on the
movement of the factors of production. So yes, let us thank free trade
for our ale.

**A.** Pedantic as that is, you are right. The EU is the successor
organisation to the EEC. It thus inherits both the positives and the
negatives of that era.

**B.** And most importantly, the EU is no longer just about maintaining
a trading block. That idea remains with us, but is now part of a greater
whole. The EU wants to become a political union. That has always been
its ultimate end. We are moving there. Slowly, yet steadily.

**A.** I hear this claim quite often. I think it is based on a false
premise, namely, the distinction between politics and trade or economics
more generally. Free trade can only be instituted as such. It is not a
natural condition. It took years of high level diplomacy before we could
reach a stable state of affairs. The same with the values of
individuality or property rights. These derive from the political
process, in the sense that there can be a politics that either denies or
reinforces them. In short, the world of trade is predicated on human
convention.

**B.** Fair enough. The distinction between the EEC and the EU pertains
to the scope of the integration process. In the former case, politicians
had the ambition to establish a trade block and nothing else. Whereas
with the EU, the ambition is to potentially have a supranational
dimension to every area of policy. Not just trade, but monetary and
fiscal affairs, police and security, social issues, and so on.

**A.** It is a difference of political agendas?

**B.** Yes. Now we can look at the historical context to appreciate the
reasons leading to this change in focus, but the point remains.

**A.** What if we suggested that instead of two agendas, the one is the
continuation of the other? Perhaps my question is best understood in
terms of the euro's integration. You start with something minimal—and I
use that term loosely here in order not to say "incomplete". So the
starting point is just a single monetary policy supported by a generic
set of macroeconomic conditions. After a while you realise that more is
needed to make it work. The Stability and Growth Pact is not
enforceable, the rules are not sufficient for realising their stated
ends, etc. So you build on top of it, in the form of the current
economic governance, only to realise that you are still missing
something. A common budget, a euro-specific legislature, the
refashioning of the Eurogroup into a proper Council formation, a euro
Commissioner or finance minister. Eventually a fully fledged
government. And so, the gradualism of the European integration process
is, in this sense, the method of realising that the initial plan can
only work as an intermediate or temporary measure towards a more
holistic solution.

**B.** Your suggestion then is that rather than treating the EEC and the
EU as fundamentally different, we see them as points on a trajectory
towards political union. That would justify the notion of "ever closer
union". It had to start from somewhere. Trade was it. But to establish
this theory of continuity, we need to look into the factors of a single
polity and whether the EU can satisfy them. Political union presupposes
a high degree of homogeneity, whereas a common market is, more or less,
a pact to eliminate trade barriers.

**A.** Homogeneity is indeed important when speaking about any kind of
union or set. There needs to be some property that qualifies the items
as parts of the whole. In politics we witness different types of
homogeneity: tribal, ethnic, and civic. Tribes can be seen as the social
extension of the family unit. Members of the tribe are relatives, the
elders are the chief decision makers, the younger ones engage in working
activities for sustenance, and so on. There is a defined hierarchy and
division of labour. Ethnic homogeneity pertains to cultural
commonalities between people who have no blood ties between them or who
are very distant relatives. A common language, a shared history, and the
overall feeling of being more or less closer to the members of the
ethnic group than to outsiders. Whereas civic homogeneity is predicated
on agreed upon values or conventions. It is the closest to a social
contract.

**B.** For obvious reasons the EU could only qualify for the civic
sort. And here we have the interesting case where ethnic sentiments can
co-exist with an overarching feeling of civic union. Whether this is a
new phenomenon, or the intermediate phase from civic union to the
formation of a new ethnic sense of belonging remains subject for another
discussion. What interests me right now is to determine whether this
supranational civic sense of togetherness—this 'Europeanness'—is in any
way the equivalent of a national identity.

**A.** The modern world order is established on the construct of the
nation state. This is the conceptual identification of a people with a
state and a given territory. International affairs are, in fact,
relations between nation states. The nation in the sense of an ethnos
could have existed from antiquity, but the nation state is a relatively
new idea. To reach this point, political thought had to draw clear
delineations between the state and other forms of hierarchical
communities, mainly those of organised religion. Secularism was the
foundation of sovereignty in its current form, for it decoupled supreme
political authority from either the monarhic or ecclesiastic
traditions. In a manner of speaking, traditional nations or new civic
ones were fastened upon the construct of the impersonalised sovereign
state, thus forming the nation state as we currently know it. Perhaps
this is the criterion of togetherness: sovereign will formation.

**B.** Is the EU sovereign?[^EUsov]

**A.** The short answer is affirmative. But seeing as the EU is a rather
complex entity with all sorts of nuances, a simple "yes" does not
suffice. Rather than speak about sovereignty as a monolithic whole, let
us refer to factors of effective sovereignty. Those are the means
necessary for the exercise of supreme political authority. Forget about
the headline features, such as whether the EU is recognised on the
global stage as a single nation or not. The EU may well not fit into the
old moulds of political thinking.

**B.** Analysing sovereignty makes sense also because of the agreed upon
distribution of competences within the EU. The Treaties foresee the
three principles of conferral, subsidiarity, and proportionality. The
idea is that whatever area of policy is explicitly given to the EU is
its own competence. It is managed by the supranational level. What is
designated as shared between the national and supranational levels, will
involve a mixture of intergovernmental and Community methods. What is
not listed remains with the nations with the EU having only an advisory
or ancillary role.

**A.** In which case, your question should be about the different
combinations and institutional arrangements that enable the EU to be
sovereign. To exercise supreme authority, that is. What you described
hints at differences of scope. There is national sovereignty, the one
where the nation is assumed to have full control over the means of
governance. There is international sovereignty, where nations agree to
pool their resources in order to mutually enhance their capacities. And
there are global agreements that set out criteria and universal
principles, including the definition of sovereignty. These too are
"supreme political authority", though they generally lack a political
agent capable of enforcing them, depending instead on decentralised
implementation.

**B.** If these are anything to go by, they would imply a revision of
the typical understanding of 'power transfers' from the Member States to
the EU. Rather than transferring power, nations are in fact uniting
their forces as a precondition for enjoying sovereignty at the national
level.

**A.** Indeed. The principle of conferral, in particular, can be
misunderstood as 'power transfers'. And there are those who insist on
the vacuous notion of 'more Europe', which can further obfuscate
things. The right way is to rethink sovereignty as immanent to the
political process. It is not limited to the nation state. It is not
fixed. Where there is politics between states which creates conditions
for future political affairs, we can say that some emergent sovereignty
is realised.[^EssaysSov]

**B.** The EU may therefore be treated as sovereign over issues where it
has explicit competence. Perhaps the same can be said for areas of
policy that are shared with the Member States, since no one nation can
act on its own.

**A.** However, note that describing it along those lines can still
given the impression of 'power transfers' and top-down control. This is
seldom the case.

**B.** True, it should instead be argued that the EU is sovereign as a
result of the Member States being jointly sovereign over their common
affairs. The distribution of competences is but a working arrangement
which renders concrete the specifics of this emergent sovereign
capacity.

**A.** Do we then need to worry that the EU is not a nation? I mean, the
emphasis on the nation presumes the construct of the nation state as
some objective, immutable magnitude. But politics evolves. We can have
areas of competence that were traditionally understood as belonging to
the national domain being instituted at a supranational level. And they
work just fine, at least in principle.

**B.** Maybe the problématique of Europe as a nation has to do with the
homogeneity we discussed earlier. This is put forward as a litmus test,
typically to suggest that since the EU is not a nation it cannot become
a single polity.

**A.** In which case, we would have to broaden our understanding of
homogeneity beyond the confines of the nation. The basic fact that there
can be a scope of sovereignty that can only be discerned as an emergent
phenomenon in inter-state relations, would suggest that a community of
interests is the minimum requirement. This can be couched in terms of
civic nationalism, but that would still carry along all the legacy of
nationalism, and the somewhat outdated concepts that surround it.

**B.** The ancient distinction between the *polis* and the *oikos* can
come in handy. This is what the Romans referred to as the *res publica*
and the *res privata*. The common and the private good. We can thus
conceive of a *republic* as a covenant predicated on common
interests. An overarching agreement to conduct the affairs of public
life in a certain way.

**A.** This is a promising approach. However, my concern is that the
term "republic" is also hinting at the nation state. Some argue that the
European Union should turn into a republic. Maybe they mean it should
become a fully fledged federation or something to that effect, but this
generally misses the point. The EU already has a res publica, and a
rather developed one at that. When for example we are discussing ways to
reform the Economic and Monetary Union, we are in fact concerned with
optimising the institutional arrangements pertinent to the management of
a segment of public life. This is sovereign will formation, whether it
is formally called that way or not.

**B.** Federalists or proponents of the 'EU as a republic' generally see
in the EU an aberration. It has elements of a confederation and a
federation, some issues are handled at the Community level, others
intergovernmentally within EU law, and others still outside the acquis
though as an extension of it. What these people want is the EU to be
streamlined. To have a canonical way of doing things, one that conforms
to standard norms of political conduct, and stick to that.

**A.** Those are fair points. Maybe an apt description for such
movements is European civic nationalism, in its numerous
variations. They may oppose 'nationalism', but what they truly mean is
that they are against European nations standing in opposition to each
other. If there is one limitation in this federalist worldview is that
it tries to model the EU after the nation state, with obvious examples
being nations that have a history of federalism. But I think the EU does
not need that. The way the integration process is unfolding hints at new
realities, new modes of polity.

**B.** Federalism and republicanism have sound principles. What you are
effectively suggesting is that we do not identify or otherwise conflate
these political theories with the historical construct of the nation
state. These ideas can apply in other contexts, whereas the nation state
is more or less confined to a specific set of arrangements.

**A.** The EU already has federalist ideas. The distribution of
competences is a prime example. It also incorporates republican
principles. Think about the operational independence of European
institutions. The EU has robust horizontal and vertical separation of
powers. The argument then is one of degree not category, i.e. that the
EU should have more or less of this or the other, not that it should be
created anew on a totally different basis.

**B.** Interesting. Homogeneity then is not inextricably bound up
together with the nation state. It can derive from the protection—or
pursuit—of a common good, such as with the European Treaties. Does that
mean that the EU is more or less complete?

**A.** No, it is not complete. There are many areas that require lots of
work. But here we are discussing the principles, not the specifics of
quotidian politics. And what we see is that the European integration
process forces us to rethink several aspects of politics. From
sovereignty to the sense of belonging. The gist of the matter is that we
should not use the nation state as the yardstick. Our results will
always be wrong that way.

**B.** I see. Shall we have another round?

**A.** Oh, why yes!

## On democracy, aristocracy, and ochlocracy

**Denis.** The Greek crisis has been going on for almost a decade. There
seems to be no end in sight. Surely, the EU could have found a
solution. Why have they not delivered?

**Carla.** The EU has a rather inefficient way of making decisions. If
it is the Community method, the European Council has to offer guidelines
on future policy. The Commission then works to materialise those ideas,
typically in the form of new legislation. The legislative process can
take years. The European Parliament and the Council have to agree
separately on any amendments they wish to introduce and then come
together to reach a compromise. And that is just the standard
method. When it comes to things like the Greek crisis, the situation is
more complex. You have the Eurogroup, which is an inter-governmental
platform that does not work exactly like the Council, and then you add
the various stakeholders, the IMF, the ESM, the ECB, the Commission. In
short, the EU has no simple way of doing things.

**Beata.** The crisis management has been proven inefficient. But you
need to appreciate the context. European integration is a process that
started in the 1950s. We are gradually harmonising the laws of the
Member States to eventually develop a political union. In the meantime,
some areas of policy remain incomplete. The governance of the euro in
this case, or other major issues such as security and defence.

**Artur.** Regarding the euro, the EU's basic problem was
two-fold. Firstly, it did not have the mechanisms to mitigate the
financial crisis. Secondly, its economic vision was heavily influenced
by neoliberalism. The architects of the single currency genuinely
believed in some of the fictions of mainstream economics, such as
efficient markets, rational expectations, and the like. They thus
thought that rational markets would correct frivolous spending of
private and public actors. So there was no real need to have
institutions in place that would do that job. To be fair towards
economics though, many economists warned against the euro. It did not
seem like it could satisfy the criteria for an optimal currency
area. The decision was political: to change the focus of the integration
process, from a single market to an economic and monetary union and,
ultimately, a political union.

**D.** How naive of them! Surely they should have known better. Rather
than start from uniting politics, they tried the riskier approach of a
suboptimal currency. The euro almost failed. That would surely have
jeopardisedd the entire project.

**B.** Perhaps they did not calculate the risks properly. But on the
balance of driving the integration process forward and not doing
anything substantial, they opted for the former. A leap forward. It is a
tricky method, though seeing as the euro is being reformed into
something more workable, they did get what they wanted. We now are at
the stage where the legal framework is almost complete. Much of the
remaining debate is on enhancing political institutions, such as a
parliament for the euro area, a fiscal capacity, and the like.

**C.** That is typical EU conduct. Some top-down set of measures that
create at least as many problems as they purport to solve. And then when
the time comes to assess whether "more Europe" has been beneficial the
various apologists argue that the 'true' solution is yet more of the
same. More power to the Brussels apparatus.

**A.** Indeed there are pro-Europeans whose lack of self-criticism can
turn them into a caricature of themselves. However, we should be careful
with generalisations. Not all arguments for deepening the integration
process come down to the largely meaningless notion of "more Europe".

**C.** Some are more refined than others, though they all essentially
agree that transferring power to the centre is a net positive.

**A.** Is this really the case though? What exactly do we mean by moving
power to Brussels? Is it like a command centre that adopts decisions
without the involvement of parliamentarians and national governments?

**C.** I mean that power is taken away from the national lifeworld, from
the locus of sovereign will-formation. Brussels is a detached
bureaucracy. It does not represent a particular people. The European
Parliament is underpowered,[^EPPower] while the Council is a glorified
platform for inter-governmental horse trading. The nation states should
not give away their sovereignty to this emerging superstate.

**B.** There is a tendency to beautify past experiences and to think of
newer ones as inherently inferior. National democracy has had its fair
share of problems, especially on handling issues with a cross-border
dimension. You speak of the EU's inefficiency in adopting decisions, but
the truth is that there is a trade-off between efficiency and
participation. The EU takes decisions by involving a large number of
stakeholders. Apart from the legislative process, it also actively
encourages feedback from civil society over a range of issues. For
example, the Commission's White Paper on the Future of Europe is a
public document meant to stimulate the debate on European
politics.[^EUFutureWhitePaper] National parliaments can discuss its
content, it could play on local media, and so on. The case of Greece is
exceptional, in that it was a unique systemic failure. Though not just
of the euro architecture, but also of the Greek state and political
establishment.

**A.** If efficiency were the only criterion for judging the propriety
of a government or its actions, then we should not be talking about
democracy. Totalitarian regimes can be more 'efficient' at executing a
single task, such as waging war or oppressing any dissenting voice. They
have all the means at their disposal and no normative or legal
constraints to stop them.

**C.** Democracy is a terrible system. It gives the impression of
participation but what really happens is that big business and powerful
interests dictate the agenda. And democracy was a misguided idea even in
ancient Athens. The Athenians sentenced Socrates to death for some
dubious reasons, exiled or forced out of the city the likes of Plato,
Aristotle, Aristides, and inflicted all sorts of injustices on the most
brilliant among them. The mob can never deliver justice. Only the
enlightened ones can, those who know what they are doing.

**D.** No wonder the philosophers were against it then. Aristocracy, the
rule of the alphas, is what they would rather have.

**A.** There are a number of interwoven topics here. Rather than discuss
them as a bundle, let us take them one by one. Helps with understanding
things. You say that democracy allows corporate interests to impose
their own plans on the rest of society. The right word for that is
corruption, or collusion, or anyhow a deviation from the norm that
should be punishable. Corruption is not intrinsic to democracy. What
happens if you have a corrupt autocrat who wields absolute sovereign
authority? That will be the most egregious form of corruption you can
get. Then you mention the Athenian political system and raise some valid
arguments about the crimes it committed. But you are missing a few
crucial insights. Athenian democracy and modern democracy are
fundamentally different. They did not have a codified corpus of primary
law, a constitution, which would institute the rule of law and guarantee
fundamental rights for individuals and groups of people. Their democracy
was, in fact, a perversion of the idea of "majority rules". For them the
rule of the majority was absolute: a zero-sum game were the minority
opinion is effectively obliterated. That is ochlocracy (rule of the
mob). Its modern variants are regimes that best qualify as
"majoritarian", if not outright authoritarian. One of the euphemisms for
those is "illiberal democracies".

**B.** And do not forget aristocracy, the darling folly of theorists who
do not care about the practicality of their models. Sure, having 'the
best' take command sounds like a decent plan. It is, after all, what
happens in every field of endeavour or expertise. But the political
whole is very much unlike purpose-specific hierarchies, such as the army
or a business. Politics encompasses all the professions, all the areas
of expertise. Politics as such is heteroclite. There can be no political
expert in the same sense there can be an army general. Anyone can be a
good politician or statesperson, not just political science graduates
and legal experts.

**D.** So there basically is no way to find the best person for ruling
over the others?

**B.** That is not exactly the point. The idea is that democracy
decentralises the process by which someone can rise to power. In a
sense, democracy creates a level playing field, so any person,
regardless of their professional or cultural background can potentially
become a leader.

**A.** Politics is not a unified area of expertise. It is a reflection
of our collective knowledge. No one can be well versed in all
specialisations. Just as there needs to be a division of labour for
productivity to pick up pace, so must politics be diversified in order
to encompass ever more of the shared knowledge. Some think that only
lawyers or policy analysts are fit for politics. But this is a
misunderstanding. You can have an established sportsperson or an artist
in charge. They have proven themselves in their own profession, have
experience with 'real life', and can bring some fresh ideas to the
table. That is invaluable.

**C.** You are still speaking about representation though. What people
really need is strong leadership. A nation that thrives. Security,
peace, a stable income. Only policy wonks or insiders care about
day-to-day politics. Most people just go about doing their business.

**A.** Is that not a division of labour though? People appoint
representatives exactly because it would be counter-productive to have
everyone deliberate over every single decision in the political
process. As for stability, you are limiting it to the surface aspects,
while omitting the qualitative ones. You can have a certain equilibrium
under an absolutist regime, which nonetheless is a miserable form of
life. There are many countries around the world that prove this. What
people really want is a dynamically stabilising equilibrium that is on
an upward trend, in terms of the availability of material goods as well
as the freedoms of quotidian life.

**B.** Authoritarianism can, at the very best, deliver stagnation. The
opposite extreme, ochlocracy can also lead to regime uncertainty,
instability, distrust in the predictability of the law, corrosion of
institutions, while making arbitrariness a common feature of the
political process. The virtue is in moderation, in the middle between
the extremes: democracy in this case.

**D.** But not like the democracy of ancient Athens?

**B.** Ancient Athens did not have constitutional norms such as the
protection of the rights of minorities, fundamental rights and
individual freedoms. The rule of law, something we now take for granted,
was secondary to the rule of the majority. Furthermore, concepts such as
nationhood and sovereignty did not exist at the time. Their democracy
was predicated on tribal relations. In effect, it was the various
families that were represented in the ecclesia of the demos. Modern
democracy typically applies to a sovereign nation state that functions
in accordance with republican and/or federalist constitutional
norms. The European Union is, in some important ways, an extension of
that idea. And modern democracy is representative, not participatory,
exactly because it would be virtually impossible to have an all
encompassing state—a nation state or the EU—while also maintaining the
kind of directness germane to tribal hierarchies. This is not to say
that greater participation is impossible or undesirable, but that there
exist certain constraints—essentially trade-offs—to what a society can
do.

**A.** Having the *aristoi* rule can be a particularly oppressive form
of top-down decision making. Perhaps the closest analogy in the modern
world is how large software multi-nationals treat the consumer. Look at
Google's or Facebook's attempts at creating their own panopticon. A
system of mass data mining that can profile everyone and make
predictions on their likely behaviour. Which is then exploited to
deliver advertisements in a manipulative way. Or look at how Microsoft
has evolved into a company that no longer sells Windows but actually
rents it out. Have you read their End User License Agreement (EULA)?
Probably not, because it is hundreds of pages of legalese, which
basically say that they have the right to maintain backdoors to your
system and control it remotely, and that they have no responsibility
whatsoever if your inherently insecure operating system gets hacked or
is effectively compromised by the NSA, other spy agencies or private
actors. Here you have the software experts, the aristoi, taking
decisions in their own interest, presumably to make things better, more
convenient. This is a form of tyranny in the making. You as a consumer
have no control over your data and the products you *think* you
bought. An aristocracy may seem like a good idea—the notion of the
philosopher king—but it can very easily become a dystopia of the worst
kind.

**C.** There is no perfect system. What matters is delivery. Getting
things done. Not dithering for what seems like an eternity.

**B.** You need results that are consistent with the dignity,
self-respect, and aspirations of people. Results that do not introduce
permanent negative effects on social groups.

**A.** Exactly! And to continue with my analogy of software companies,
it is no surprise that more and more indiviuals, small businesses,
non-profit organisations, and public bodies are turning towards
free-libre software; software that is made for the community of users
for the sole purpose of having a workable computer with useful
applications. People choose free-libre software because of its intrinsic
freedom. They understand that they may have to learn a few new things,
or adapt their workflow in some areas, but they value their freedom to
choose over the convenience of a corporate black box that spies on them
and abuses them.

**D.** Seems like an aristocratic variant of the EU would be a
despicable elitism. While an ochlocratic or majoritarian one would
always favour a group of states against all others. A zero-sum game. At
least the current system guarantees broad-based consensus or agreement
over most issues. Sure, it can work better and that is where the efforts
should be focused on. Communication is key. Just like with the
publication of the White Paper on the Future of the EU or the reflection
papers that followed it. Europe needs more of that. So that non-geeks
such as myself can better understand what "Brussels" really
is. Otherwise, the myth of the "detached bureaucracy" will persist. But
enough of that, I need another whisky.

**A.** I am a simple fellow. I hear "whisky" and I nod my head in
agreement.

## On federalism and European integration

**Artur.** When it comes to European politics, are you a
federalist?[^EUFed]

**Beata.** In principle, I am in favour of a European Union that
operates as a fully fledged republic. I guess that qualifies me as a
federalist, though I do not necessarily insist on the EU having to
follow in the footsteps of other nations, such as the USA or
Switzerland.

**A.** Those paradigms you are alluding to support the theory espoused
by many of the "United States of Europe". I think the US model has more
currency than the Swiss one. But you say you do not want that, yet you
still believe the EU should operate as a proper republic. My question
then should be whether you think the EU already follows federalist
constitutional norms. Does it?

**B.** The typical self-defined federalist would argue that the EU is
not a federation. And I agree. There are too many elements that are
inter-governmental. These reflect competing national agendas. The
policies they make are not meant to directly promote some European
good. They are a compromise between governments, based on criteria such
as expedience and the promotion of the national interest. The way the
Greek crisis has been handled is a case in point. A federation would
initiate procedures to restructure Greek debt and have Greece default
within the euro area. Instead, a series of technical measures have been
turned into a set of hotly contested political totems. Everyone who
thinks objectively agrees that debt relief is a
necessity. Inter-governmental politics has hitherto prevented that from
happening in an orderly and timely fashion.

**A.** What you are describing is fair enough, but I do not see this
overall inefficiency as proof that the EU does not already function in
accordance with federalist constitutional norms. The mistake is to
conflate matters of principle with quotidian politics. You object to the
EU's inter-governmentalist practices on grounds of practicality. Look at
the US, the darling of many a federalist. One can hardly forget the
seemingly endless negotiations for such 'technical' items as raising the
debt ceiling. Major disagreements exist in every kind of polity. These
lead to deadlocks or, anyhow, tend to prolong and complicate a process
that would seem rather simple and straightforward. What the euro crisis
really teaches us is that without sufficient institutional arrangements
and predefined mechanisms, a major crisis is enough to fuel controversy,
distrust, and to ultimately make any solution much more difficult than
what it would have been.

**B.** So your suggestion is that we treat inefficiencies as technical
rather than normative constraints?

**A.** Indeed! Constitutional norms are one thing, the political process
is another.

**B.** So which are the constitutional norms that, in your mind, qualify
as federalist?

**A.** Everything pertaining to the distribution of competences within
the EU is a good start. We have the connatural principles of conferral,
subsidiarity, and proportionality. Conferral means that certain powers
are explicitly given to the European level, while others are shared
between the Union and the Member States. Whatever is not conferred
upward remains with the nation state. The Union can only have an
ancillary or marginal role on such policies. What makes the principle of
conferral something better than the misunderstood "power transfers to
Brussels" is that it has to be consistent with subsidiarity. The EU
should not be granted powers that are not of a Union-wide reach, for
that would violate the principle which stipulates that decisions should
be taken at the closest level of government pertinent to the task at
hand. Finally, proportionality ensures that any power is limited in
scope and any action thereof must not create conditions that would
change that constitutional order. To my mind, these establish a vertical
separation of powers within a multi-level polity. That is a federalist
tenet.

**B.** Yes, but that is not the whole story. The EU does not have an
elected executive. In fact, it does not have a *single executive*, but
two institutions that perform complementary functions. The European
Commission is typically likened to a government. In practice it does
what any national executive would do. However, the Commission's impetus
to action is exogenous. It does not decide on the direction of the
integration process. That task is trusted with the European Council, the
platform where the heads of state or government meet. The European
Council is, in fact, the Union's deciding executive. It adopts
'guidelines' that the Commission must follow. To that end, the
Commission is the implementing executive. Such bifurcation is not
standard for federations. A federal Europe would have an elected
government, which could be led by a prime minister or a president
depending on what would work best for us.

**A.** This is one of the many peculiarities of the EU. And there are
other examples that add force to your argument, such as the practice of
differentiated integration, what is commonly known as "multi-speed
Europe". The EU is not a unified whole, but a mosaic or patchwork of
multiple combinations of Union, with states advancing at a different
pace or towards diverging ends. The common thread is the European
Treaties. Every instance of differentiated integration must be
consistent with them, such as the fiscal compact or the treaty that
established the European Stability Mechanism.

**B.** Which is why we often speak of the EU as being *sui generis*. It
is in a league of its own.

**A.** Well, yes. Though I do not find that line of reasoning
particularly interesting and fecund. Federations are quite
diverse. Switzerland is a federation, so is Belgium, Germany, and even
Russia. It would be pointless to argue that these systems are more or
less the same solely by virtue of qualifying as federations. Every
polity has its unique features. And that is to be expected given that in
each case decisions are adopted within a different context, against the
backdrop of unique historical-cultural path dependencies. What I am
interested in is to identify the things federations have in common or,
more specifically, what democracy within a federal system looks like.

**B.** So how would you conceive of the various aberrations of EU
politics. Inter-governemntalism or the bifurcation of the executive
mentioned earlier? Are these consistent with federalism?

**A.** The way to approach those issues is by looking at the history of
the integration process. We have an early attempt in the 1950s at the
creation of a single market. In the 1990s this culminates in the
refashioning of the European Economic Community into the European
Union. A single currency is introduced, supranational competences are
expanded, the European Parliament gains a more central role. Looking
ahead, we contemplate several elements of a fiscal, financial, security,
and even political union. We also are at the beginning of a process that
will deliver us a European army or, at the very least, an ever closer
form of coordination on matters of security and defence. Fiscal policy
or the military are cardinal expressions of statehood. But we are not
there yet. Just as the euro initially lacked certain institutions that
would render it robust to shocks, so the various areas of European
policy are still under development.

**B.** Following that train of thought, you would treat the aberrations
as intermediate steps towards a potential normality?

**A.** For the most part, yes. I think that as the integration process
deepens, we reach a point where practices of the past are no longer
tenable. Ten to fifteen years ago the idea of a fiscal union was near
blasphemy. Today it is the most sensible course of action. Do not
underestimate the shift in thinking brought about by material
changes. Oftentimes people must see things in their immediacy in order
to appreciate the importance and propriety of certain actions.

**B.** Fair enough. Would an elected government for the EU be consistent
with the step-by-step process you outlined?

**A.** An elected government as a replacement for the College of
Commissioners would be the logical extension of the spitzenkandidaten
process. Ideally we would have transnational lists for Members of the
European Parliament, from where the new government could come from. What
I do not think is absolutely necessary, is the abolition of the European
Council. I have come to believe that a deciding executive, one that can
think long term and reach a consensus among European nations, is
ultimately useful. Perhaps though, a deciding executive should have a
more specialised role, such as on matters of primary law—amending the
Treaties—or for instance where differentiated integration is indeed a
necessity. The specifics may vary and I need not digress at length.

**B.** What you have put forward seems to explain why certain
self-styled federalists are fervently pro-EU. There are, however, those
who think that the EU is a step away from federalism. It is a
confederation, whose midpoint is the nation state and the national
interest.

**A.** The problem with concepts such as "federation" or "confederation"
is that they are not defined in precise terms. There are no clear
delineations between the two. The same is true for the notion of the
unitary state. Greece is such a state and so is Spain or the United
Kingdom. While they all are formally the same, there are profound
differences. Greece does not devolve power to regional governments. In
the UK the system is close to a federation. Spain's case is similar. At
the other extreme, we have Russia, a federation that tends to be
governed as an ever centralising unitary state. The only way to claim
that the EU is this or the other is by means of comparison to some other
federal system, say, the USA. While that is a worthy endeavour, it
should not be definitive. We already touched on the uniqueness of each
polity and the importance of history. Furthermore, we must keep the
gradualism of the integration process in perspective. The EU is not the
end product. It evolves, so give this moving target time to mature.

**B.** A federalist, therefore, would be someone who insists on a
direction to the integration process that greatly expands upon the
existing federalist principles of the EU. They would want the
non-federalist elements, such as inter-governmental affairs, to be
reduced to a minimum. Quotidian politics would thus be allowed to unfold
along the lines of federalist political theory. What you have not
mentioned is the constitution. Federalists would want one too.

**A.** I would rather speak about primary law, because the constitution
is an instance of that. In international relations, treaties have a
special function as they are above the national constitutions. Treaties
do not replace national basic law though, but frame it over a certain
set of issues. Trade agreements have the same effect. The European
Treaties are, in essence, a form of inter-state covenant. But there is
much more to them. European law, as developed through the integration
process and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, has
substantive qualities that do not require national constitutions to
apply.

**B.** Such as the principle of direct effect...

**A.** Yes. Even if a Member State does not transpose European
legislation into national law, a citizen can still claim any rights
emanating from it.

**B.** Still, you are not referring specifically to a constitution.

**A.** The constitution is a codified corpus of primary law, whose
codification happens within the national or cultural lifeworld. There
can be a constitutional order without a single formal document, such as
in the United Kingdom. European primary law has developed from a small
set of generic trade agreements into a rich corpus of norms and legal
principles. The European citizenship and fundamental rights are some
headline examples. Apart from the material implications on individuals,
the Treaties define the EU architecture, the roles of all entities
involved, the distribution of competences, even the provisions for
exiting the Union. They set out a fully fledged republic, even though it
is not referred to as such. For all intents and purposes, the Treaties
are a constitution. Unless, of course, we want to insist on regarding
them as international law, which completely ignores the specifics of the
European integration process.

**B.** Is this a good constitution though? Would a federalist be
satisfied with it.

**A.** I have said nothing about my evaluation of it. My position
concerns matters of principle. Qualitative issues are another discussion
altogether. Seeing as I am running out of beer and am a bit tired, I
cannot comment at length, so I will just share some final thoughts on
federalism.

**B.** Shall I order another round? Half pints at least?

**A.** Judging from the content of our discussion, I think we had enough
already. I digress. Federalism is a sound worldview and European
federalists have made several important contributions to the thinking
about Europe. What we need to bear in mind though is that the federalist
movement need not fundamentally refashion the existing
architecture. Several of its facets already conform with federalist
tenets. And this will only be made ever more apparent once key policy
areas are integrated further, such as fiscal policy, security and
defence. As for the qualitative parameters, these no longer concern
federalism per se, but only sensible policy making.

**B.** The bill please.

    discussion with Jakub Jermář*. Published on December 6, 2016.

## On EU differentiated integration

**Denis.** You once told me that the concept of "two-speed Europe" is
actually misleading. Would you care to elaborate?

**Artur.** Since you bought me my single malt, I will gladly do
so. Where should we start from?

**D.** Why is "two-speed Europe" inaccurate?

**A.** This concept refers to the European integration process. It
basically means that not all EU Member States are at exactly the same
level in the integration process. The reason "two-speed Europe" is
problematic is because there are in fact multiple speeds and tiers or
directions.

**Beata.** Which is why you refer specifically to the European
integration process, rather than just the EU.

**A.** The European Union is the constitutional order that emerges from
the integration process. The Union's primary law, the Treaties, are the
cornerstone of this process. However, there are certain cases where
European leaders choose to work outside the EU framework. The reasons
may vary, though it usually comes down to political expedience.

**B.** Such as when they signed the fiscal compact or the treaty
establishing the European Stability Mechanism. Strictly speaking, these
were outside EU proper. Right?

**A.** They were, hence the conceptual distinction between the EU
constitutional order and the integration process. The key point though
is that the two are complementary. Whatever happens within the context
of the integration process will eventually become part of the European
Union; part of the acquired legal order, the Community acquis. The
fiscal compact, for instance, is an integral part of the Economic and
Monetary Union's governance. The fact that it technically is outside the
proper EU order does not render it any less important, some *European
law manqué*.

**D.** So what exactly is it with the fiscal compact that could not
qualify it as ordinary EU law?

**B.** Not all Member States agreed to it.

**D.** So how did it come to pass?

**B.** The Treaties provide scope for "enhanced cooperation" or, in the
case of security and defence, "permanent structured
cooperation".[^FutureCSDP] Practically the same. Coalitions of willing
and able Member States can proceed with deepening their integration in
line with the Treaties. Other countries are allowed to join in at a
later stage. And so, we have several instances of such enhanced
cooperation which create those multiple speeds and directions. The
technical term is "differentiated integration".

**D.** I see. So what are some other examples of differentiated
integration? You know, just the big picture.

**A.** One is the Schengen passport-free area which even encompasses
non-EU countries. Though perhaps the best example for our discussion is
the euro. Back in the early 1990s some countries were raising objections
to the idea of a European single currency. To circumvent the obstacle of
veto rights, a decision was taken to allow those with reservations to
opt out of the euro, giving the others the chance to proceed with
monetary integration.

**B.** And the euro is a great example of differentiated integration in
that it has multiple speeds but also multiple directions. Of the
countries that agreed with the idea of a single currency, some have
joined, others are expected to join once they meet certain criteria,
while Sweden is technically in the process of deciding how it wants to
proceed. Those are the multiple speeds. The formal opt out clauses
represent different directions.

**D.** It seems to me that this greatly increases the complexity of
European politics.

**B.** It does, especially if one wants to be precise. On the flip-side
though, it is a means of driving the integration process forward.

**Carla.** There are major downsides though that you seem to pass over
in silence. What this cherry picking does is increase the pressure on
non-participating Member States. The more the 'core' EU comes closer
together, the higher the difficulty for others to keep up. The way the
euro was ushered in was just a misguided idea, a sacrifice to the altar
of ever closer union. Consensus should always be the guiding
principle. Nations are equal and should be treated as such. What we are
increasingly seeing is some Member States leading the charge, bypassing
the objections of others.

**B.** There are risks. Alienating groups of states could ultimately be
detrimental to the longer term prospects of the EU. That is unlikely
though, seeing as the countries that do proceed further are becoming
more like a unified whole. There are strong bonds and powerful
incentives to stay the course.

**A.** There is a more abstract, yet vital insight as well. One of the
side effects of the gradualism of European integration is that many
areas of policy can only become fully fledged over time. The initial
programme may not cover every case or be robust to a range of
shocks. The euro is, once again, a case in point. A monetary union is
established. Fiscal rules are generic and there is no coordinated
macroeconomic policy. Prudential oversight over the banking sector
remains limited to the national level, with no monitoring of systemic
phenomena. It soon becomes readily apparent that the model is
insufficient and unsustainable. Fiscal rules need to be more specific
and enforceable. Economic coordination is needed to better promote
convergence. Banks require system-wide oversight. These reforms were
implemented in the midst of the euro crisis, with the fiscal compact
being part of the deal. Currently we are approaching the next phase of
this overarching attempt at creating a genuine Economic and Monetary
Union: everyone realises that without a supranational fiscal capacity
and without the commensurate democratic legitimacy and accountability,
the system will remain fragile. I thus believe that the gradualism of
the integration process causes incrementalism on the policy front. In
other words, incrementalism is germane to gradualism. Enhanced
cooperation thus functions as the instrument that releases the built-up
pressure, preventing things from imploding when universal consensus is
not possible.

**D.** So basically your suggestion is that once a major push is set in
motion, it is difficult to revert the changes it brings along. It also
is impractical to remain in the intermediate phase as that would be the
worst of both worlds.

**A.** Take the European Stability Mechanism as an example. It too is
part of the differentiated integration we have been witnessing. Without
this fiscal backstop, without some countries agreeing to set it up,
while letting others pursue their own priorities, the euro would have
collapsed. Or, at the very least, the pressures would have been much
greater. And that would mean a far more grinding economic crisis.

**C.** But the way you put it makes it sound like an organic
phenomenon. It just emerges from the circumstances. What about the
Europeanist agenda of ever closer union? Why not consider this part of a
greater plan at unscrupulously realising a political union?

**A.** My theory is consistent with my overall view that circumstances
condition the behaviour of situational agents and patients. Past events
tend to delineate the realm of possibility of future decisions. But I do
not subscribe to a naive variant of determinism whereby the
circumstances themselves cause new circumstances ad infinitum or in a
self perpetuating way. Yes, the choice to proceed with the euro in the
first place was political. In some sense it could be seen as a leap of
faith. At that time, they could have just settled with the single
market. Anyhow, the current politicians could not just go back in time
and prevent things from happening. Their choice was between inaction and
a compromise with a form of action that may not have been optimal or the
most desirable in a general sense. Inaction would have caused more
problems than it would have solved, which practically limits the margin
of choice to practicalities and details.

**B.** This is similar to the argument of Greece exiting the euro. Some
say "why can't we just go back to where we were before?". Once you are
in, conditions have changed so dramatically that the previous state of
affairs no longer exists. Exit would not revert to the pre-euro days,
but to a new scenario of non-euro days.

**D.** The euro crisis was an exceptional case though. Here I can
understand why differentiated integration was pretty much a
necessity. But how about the euro in the first place, or some plans I am
hearing of having enhanced cooperation over security and defence? What
is the pressure for not seeking out unanimity?

**B.** The original decision to go with the euro was also adopted under
a certain degree of pressure. The single market cannot function
optimally with wide discrepancies between states over a range of
macroeconomic issues, such as inflation and longer term interest
rates. Similarly, on issues of security and defence, we are confronted
with a range of threats, from terrorism, to resurgent regional powers,
to cyber offensives, and the like. European leaders face the choice of
either doing nothing or trying to integrate further in order to cope
with the challenges. Differentiated integration is the only tool they
have if some countries are obstinately refusing to proceed. Again, there
are downsides to a multi-speed, multi-directional Europe, but inaction
can well prove even more costly.

**D.** Basically this means that there is no coming back to a one-speed,
one-direction Europe. There is divergence, which over time can culminate
into an EU exit: what the United Kingdom is doing.

**C.** No wonder the Brits want to leave. They see all this and think
that the eventuality of a political union will not be to their
benefit. National sovereignty is preferable to a superstate spearheaded
by Germany and France.

**B.** There are many reasons underpinning Brexit. The UK was a
reluctant member from the start. Do not forget though that not all
British people want to leave. This is the sad outcome of marginal
majorities being allowed to have constitutional ramifications. Also, we
should not rush to conclusions on this matter. Negotiations are still
underway. Maybe Brexit will not be what some hardliners would wish
for. At any rate, I guess that a 'soft' Brexit will only further
reinforce the idea that differentiated integration is a viable option.

**A.** It all comes down to pragmatism. Europeans can pretend to be one
big happy family with no disagreements whatsoever, or they can agree to
disagree and implement policies that are necessary under the prevailing
conditions. There are no instances of a perfect course of
action. Politics is about finding the most optimal trade-off between
possible pros and cons within a given set of circumstances. EU exit can
be a major downside that needs to be balanced out with potential gains
from the emergent sovereignty of sharing power and pooling resources at
the supranational level. I expect differentiated integration to become
ever more prevalent as one series of enhanced cooperation compounds
another. Whatever the case though, we should remember that the
integration process is not being fragmented. Everything becomes part of
the aqcuis as Europe moves to a new position.

**D.** All this talk makes me thirsty. Let me buy us a round of
something light. Gin and tonic.

**A.** That is not how you pronounce "whisky".

**B.** You are shameless!

**A.** I prefer "connoisseur".

## On referenda and democracy

**Artur.** Shall we pick up the discussion from where we left it the
other day?

**Beata.** What was it about?

**A.** Referenda. Whether they are sufficient or appropriate in modern
politics and for what reasons.

**Denis.** Interesting topic. First though, remind me of that long drink
you bought me yesterday.

**A.** Brandy sour?

**D.** That one.

**A.** Though I do prefer my drinks neat, I can recognise a decent
compromise. In a long glass you add two to three ice cubes. Then five to
six drops of Angostura bitters. Proceed with a measure of brandy and an
equal portion of fresh lemon juice. Top up with sparkling water. Stir
mildly and serve with a wedge of lemon. Simple and delightful,
especially if you use some good quality brandy.

**D.** Great, I shall have one of those.

**B.** So, referenda. We were talking about Brexit and the fact that the
"leave" camp had barely won. The result of the Brexit referendum is a
generic opinion of a marginal majority that is allowed to have
far-reaching ramifications, including of the constitutional
sort.[^ColignatusBrexit]

**Carla.** That is democracy. The rule of the majority. Simple.

**A.** The rule of the majority is but a facet of modern democracy. If
we take what you claim at face value, then the only democracy is the
ancient Athenian one or something of that sort. And we already discussed
that system's capacity for abuse of power against minority opinions,
individuals or groups thereof.

**C.** This is typical Brussels apologia. Whenever the people vote
against the superstate a chorus of EU panegyrists will seek to
delegitimise the very notion of popular vote. Why can't you just accept
that the EU is a much maligned entity?

**B.** "Much maligned" is an exaggeration. Sure, there are people who
hold strong feelings against it or at least against certain policies.
Just as there are others who are fervent exponents of it. But it is
outright erroneous to infer that most people are against the EU. The
American and British media in particular have got it all wrong with the
various europhobic movements. They gave them much more importance than
they deserved. People in Europe have seen the likes of Trump and would
rather not give power to someone of his kind. Your data is partial and
inaccurate.

**A.** Technicalities aside, Carla touches on a matter of principle that
is worth considering in its own right. What is the place of referenda in
a modern republic.

**C.** Yes, my view is that the will of the people is the ultimate
authority within the state. When the majority decides, all others must
fall in line.

**A.** And what if we do not know what exactly is the majority's
decision. Can you give an objective definition of the phrase "Brexit
means Brexit"?

**C.** That is political rhetoric. A simple comment. Let us not attach
more value to it than what it merits.

**B.** So what exactly does the "yes" vote mean in terms of the
specifics of exiting the Union?

**C.** The particulars are for diplomats to figure out and legislators
to enact. The people defined the overarching theme. No more EU
membership.

**A.** I find a certain tension in this line of reasoning. On the one
hand, the highly complex maters of EU membership, international trade,
and international relations, are reduced to a simple binary choice. On
the other, we do not expect the people who decide on that set of
cardinal issues to actually have any say over their implications. You
recognise that the particulars require a certain degree of
expertise. But then you are fine with simplistic reasoning, with
describing the EU and the European integration process as a monolithic
whole, as something that is either all or nothing. The truth of the
matter is that there are various permutations between membership and
association with the EU that simply cannot be described in simple terms
and presented as a binary choice.

**C.** You are basically suggesting that the people are a bunch of fools
and that only experts should deal with politics?

**A.** No, far from it. My problem is with fallacious reductionism. Even
the world's greatest expert cannot deliver a definitive judgement when
their only choice is between a generic "yes" or "no". Complexity of this
sort should be considered by the parliament, the most appropriate body
in a state. This gives people's representatives the chance to examine
the specifics and to introduce amendments wherever
necessary. Deliberation is key. If a referendum is an absolute
necessity, it can be on the ultimate decision of the parliament, not
vice versa.

**C.** Parliamentarians are representatives of the people. Their power
is derived from the bottom. To that end, you cannot have parliament
impose conditions on the people. Sovereignty always is popular
sovereignty.

**A.** This is a concept that arguably comes from the French Revolution,
with which I have some major disagreements. I find it incomplete. Take
the case of a republic. The people agree on a constitution, which
defines their state. The constitution essentially is the framework that
allows for the pooling of resources at a level above the individual,
such as the community or the nation. The state is the means through
which the people can become sovereign. Now consider the legitimation
process. The people legitimise the primary law and the institutions of
the state. Then the laws of the state do in turn render legal and
acceptable the norms that govern relations between people within the
territory of its jurisdiction. Popular sovereignty and state sovereignty
exist in a virtuous cycle. I refer to all this as "democratic
sovereignty".

**B.** And republics have a balance between the power of the people and
that of the state. If all power rests with the state we have
totalitarianism. Whereas if all power stays with the people we have
anarchy. Now, the logical conclusion of popular sovereignty being the
only one is that anarchy is the most appropriate political
system. However, even anarchists agree that they need certain
institutions to govern their life. These may not form a state per se,
but perform the exact same political functions. Institutions such as
individual liberty—yes this is an institution that should not be taken
for granted—or the principle of private property. Opinions may vary
though that is the general idea.

**D.** So you are basically saying that the state and the people are
kind of equals that exist in a symbiotic relationship? Okay, maybe that
is not an apt description, but that one may not be fully realised
without the other?

**A.** When it comes to republics, I think that is the case. Depending
on the situation or the policy area at hand, we witness power flowing
from the bottom to the top or vice versa. Hence the argument that
democratic sovereignty is the virtuous cycle of legitimation between the
people and the state.

**D.** You mean that there is no fixed hierarchy?

**A.** Order is context-dependent. Republics provide scope for choosing
the most appropriate course of action and synthesising the various means
of decision-making.

**B.** This is unlike the extremes of absolute state or non-state,
totalitarianism or anarchism. Moderation is a virtue, as Aristotle would
put it. One of the uniting themes of those systems is that they demand a
robust, immutable hierarchy. Which can lead to a tyranny of the few or
of the many, of the central authority or the local community.

**D.** Like ancient Athens that we examined the other day? Though if I
recall correctly there was something else that the Athenians lacked.

**B.** A codified corpus of primary law that protected certain
inalienable rights. In Europe we have an advanced legal system, where
fundamental rights are being protected by law. The freedom of speech,
the presumption of innocence, the distinction between criminal and civil
offenses, and so on. We cherish the rule of law. No majority can simply
vote to censor some group of people or, worse, agree to sentence one to
death. The Athenians were experts at that, exactly because they had no
such legal mechanisms.

**A.** And this relates to my claim that the state too has
sovereignty. Only the state can protect freedoms in a manner that is
objective, consistent, and immune to mood swings fueled by demagogic
rhetoric.

**C.** This theory of democratic sovereignty is just too
idealistic. Tells us nothing about the real world. I mean, look at the
influence of political parties, lobbyists, big business. We need someone
to clean up this mess. In the meantime though, the political elite is
not to be trusted. Referenda are the only means people have to
circumvent the powers that be and make their voice clear.

**A.** Corruption can exist in any system. It is not germane to
democracy, to the presence of political parties, or whatnot. As for
referenda being an instrument against the establishment, that is but an
illusion, a pernicious fancy of populists. You forget that it is this
'elite' that will interpret the result of the referendum, set
priorities, carry out negotiations, and enact the relevant legislation.

**B.** Speaking of idealism, is not 'the people' that toils against the
machinations of 'the elite' an ideal as well? Has anyone actually ever
seen this exalted hive mind? The fact is that citizens have a variety of
opinions over a range of issues. Complexity is key. Speaking in the name
of the people is a sign of self-righteousness, of deciding yourself what
the ostensibly homogeneous body of citizens actually believes is the
case. That is the work of charlatans.

**D.** But is not the state also acting in the name of the people? And
are not elected officials acting on behalf of the people?

**B.** Yes, but there is a distinction to be made. Firstly, the state
acts with the long term good in mind, not just what the majority of the
people believe in present time. That is why we speak, among others, of
the need to protect the environment or to have sound state
finances. These are matters of inter-generational justice, which only
the state can properly address. As for citizens' representatives, these
stand for certain ideas and are typically elected on a partisan
platform. The government and the parliament thus need to balance their
own ideology with the needs and priorities of the state.

**A.** Apart from everything we discussed thus far, here is the problem
with having a simple majority effectively decide on the constitutional
order of the state. There is no orderly functioning state where the
primary law can be influenced by means of a straightforward vote. And I
speak about constitutional issues since EU membership has exactly that
effect. There needs to be a qualified majority for changing the
constitution and, in some cases, snap elections where the new parliament
must also ratify the revised law. There are checks in place. By
stipulating that the will of the people is absolute we are effectively
obliterating any attempt at a compromise, at the synthesis of views that
is necessary to have some degree of inter-generational
justice. Referenda can be useful, provided they follow the same norms of
republicanism. Reifying the people into a single-minded whole, while
treating its will as absolute, only makes it impossible to argue against
its decision. That is dogma.

**C.** There is no perfect way of doing things. The referendum sends a
clear signal of what the majority wants. And the majority knows quite
well what is good for them and their posterity.

**B.** Except that the referendum does not send a clear message. The
fact that the result needs to be interpreted means that the government
can instrumentalise this 'dogma' Artur spoke of to pass through any kind
of agenda, including a very partisan one that is not representative of
the distribution of views within the society.

**A.** We said before that the state is a pooling of resources that
enables the people to be sovereign. To comment on your claim that the
majority knows what is good for the coming generations consider the
important separation between micro and macro spheres. Families may know
what is good for their children, but only a macro entity can avoid the
pitfalls of paradoxes to private action that appear in the transition
from the micro to the macro level. Just as only a central authority with
macroeconomic power has the means to break the vicious cycle of the
paradox of thrift. Only the state can, for instance, run deficits in
order to finance a transition to an ecological form of production and
consumption. And only it can mobilise resources in pursuit of
system-wide programmes that will deliver results ten or twenty years
into the future. Micro and macro scopes should always be in our mind
when we discuss social, political, and of course economic
issues. Otherwise our conclusions will always be hindered by prior
misunderstandings.

**D.** Okay, I have had enough of this! Now that you said "micro", have
you considered a venture into micro-brewing. Who knows, you might be
able to make something like the Trappist ales.

**C.** Now that is something I would be keen on!

**B.** We can also add our own spin to the recipe. Berries, pineapple,
peach, kiwi. All the goodies.

**A.** My dears, only the good monks of Belgium have the resources to
produce a beer as fine as that. And their most valuable quality is their
resistance to the temptation of adding such exotic ingredients. Trust
me.

## On individualism, neoliberalism, and democracy

**Carla.** You cannot separate neoliberalism from the euro. The two are
inextricably bound up together.

**Beata.** You mean that there can be no other policy than a neoliberal
one? Elections are irrelevant?

**C.** A newly elected government cannot just go ahead and implement its
agenda. It has to comply with the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact
and all the other laws relevant to the governance of the Economic and
Monetary Union. And since European legislation cannot just be amended at
the national level, the government must be fortunate enough to find
allies in Europe in order to try and reform the EU. Practically
impossible. The very design of this system perpetuates neoliberal policy
making. Only EU exit, with the corresponding repatriation of
sovereignty, can ensure a path away from the neoliberal paradigm.

**Artur.** I think we need to disaggregate the subjects of our inquiry,
otherwise our conclusions will not be accurate enough. You seem to be
bundling together the euro and the EU. I think that is a mistake, for
the former is narrower in scope than the latter.

**Denis.** I suspect that sweeping generalisation of the sort "the EU is
neoliberal" cannot withstand scrutiny. Things are more complex than
that.

**B.** They are. The EU engages with a whole range of policies that are
to the benefit of the average consumer. From environmental policy, to
food safety, to the protection of the single market from monopolistic
practices. And of course there are the more pertinent issues of
migration and asylum, security and defence, as well as police
cooperation against terrorism. Have you not seen the decisive action of
the European Commission against the dubious business practices of the
likes of Apple and Google?

**C.** Fair enough. Let's stick to the euro. Do you not see that
neoliberalism is enshrined in the very framework that governs Europe's
single currency?

**B.** The rules of the system are primarily focused on sound state
finances. However, as the EMU proceeds towards greater integration, the
intention is to closely monitor systemic or cross-border macroeconomic
phenomena. Thus the policy recommendations will not be just about fiscal
discipline, but also about reforms and structural adjustments. The
intention is to achieve convergence between the Member States.

**C.** Structural reforms and the like are the buzzwords used to conceal
the fact that a concerted offensive is to be launched against the
weakest in society as well as trade unions.

**A.** I think we need to keep things in perspective. Yes, the euro was
conceived as a predominantly neoliberal project. That was back in the
1990s, when the Western establishment thought it had won the battle of
ideas. For them there was no alternative to the conventional economic
wisdom of the time. Still, we should not forget the primary purpose of
the single currency, which had little to do with macroeconomics per
se. The euro is a political project, a driver for further integration
towards political union. What that means in practice is that the
underlying thinking does not simply follow the views of eminent
economists. For instance, the euro was arguably not conforming with the
model of an Optimal Currency Area. It came into being regardless.

**C.** Where are you going with this historical overview?

**A.** To argue that prevailing ideas are trapped in the web of their
era. Since the 2007+ economic crisis it has become readily apparent that
many of the headline issues of 20th century macroeconomics were in need
of thoroughgoing revision. It is simply irresponsible in this day and
age to blindly subscribe to the ideology of the likes of F.A. Hayek and
Milton Friedman. In practice, we are moving away from such minarchistic
tendencies. Even central banks have changed their thinking.[^ECBreview]
Their current policies are being referred to as "unconventional" when in
fact they should be understood as the new conventions of monetary
policy. The central bank is expected to actively seek to manipulate
yield curves and help complement the policy initiatives on the fiscal
front. We blithely speak about neoliberalism in the same way people did
in the 1980s and 1990s, while we pretend to neglect just how much the
world is changing around us.

**C.** Sure, things change, yet much remains the same. Neoliberalism is
as much about economics as it is about ethics. It rests on individualism
and postulates that individuals bear full responsibility for anything
good or bad that happens to them.

**B.** That is true. Individualism is the underlying morality of
neoliberalism, but also of other schools of economic thought, such as
the Austrians, from where Hayek comes from.

**A.** Though I would argue that individualism can be traced back to
Biblical mythology as well as the secular ethics of
anthropocentrism. Human is believed to be free in a decontextualised
sense. To have free will no matter the circumstances. With absolute
freedom comes absolute bliss or punishment. Heaven or hell. That kind of
binary. No wonder the USA is the land of 'economic freedom' and the
number one country in terms of incarcerations. Now, I am a free will
sceptic, because I recognise that both natural and social-cultural
forces can mould and determine human action. It would be a mystery for
the human body, a biological system of chemical reactions, to somehow be
immune to the forces of probabilistic cause and effect. It also seems
outright false to ignore the social, cultural, historical structure
within which human agency is made manifest. It is pointless to speak
about some decontextualised individual freedom in an otherwise
oppressive society. Think about social exclusion, racial segregation
including the case of ghetto areas, domestic violence, mistreatment of
women, discrimination against LGBT people, and so on. We need to look at
the contextualised human being, which requires a more holistic
understanding of the environing factors and conditions.

**C.** That is high level stuff. I do not see what your point is with
regard to the euro's inherent neoliberalism.

**A.** In continental Europe we do not have such a strong view of
individualism as do the Americans. Or such tribalist or feudalist social
organisation as do the Saudi Arabians. The welfare state in Europe is
much more advanced compared to the rest of the world. What we lack in
the European Union is not principles. It is the instruments for social
policy that exist at the national level. The reason we think of the euro
as primarily neoliberal is because only its fiscal, monetary, and
financial aspects have been integrated at the supranational level. We
thus have a mismatch, where the emphasis naturally is on macroeconomic
metrics rather than society. But this problem has nothing to do with
some unflinching commitment to radical individualism. It is a side
effect of the gradualism of the European integration
process. Corrections will come in the form of a supranational fiscal
capacity, which will, among others, provide automatic stabilisers across
Member States. That is the direction.

**C.** Europe has the same religious or philosophical world-view as the
USA. Why do you discount the power that individualist morality has?

**A.** Because action on the policy front already indicates a shift to a
more holistic morality, even though it is not couched in those terms. I
will provide two examples of practical ethics beyond individualism. The
first is Europe's fiscal framework. Yes, the ostensibly built-in
austerity drive of the system. Sound state finances are, from a moral
perspective, a commitment of the current generation to not place any
burdens on their posterity. Inter-generational justice. Social justice,
if you will. The second example is environmental policy. Practical
ecological thinking and action helps mitigate some of the most
pernicious externalities of human conduct and, once again, represents a
tacit commitment to respect this planet for all of its species, us and
those yet to be, for us at home and those in other countries.

**B.** I must admit that I have trouble with your first example. How is
fiscal discipline not neoliberal?

**A.** Because you are confusing the principles it covers with the
politics of the euro crisis. Europe's problem can be described as a
failure to adapt its policies to changing circumstances in the
economy. Fiscal discipline should apply in times of economic expansion,
while it should be relaxed during recessions.

**D.** But EU policy makers insisted on implementing austerity in the
midst of the economic downturn. Is that not an obsession?

**A.** It was misguided, though justifiable once put in its proper
historical perspective. The euro was launched with a generic set of
fiscal rules that were practically unenforceable. There were no
institutions for providing a fiscal backstop to the monetary union,
while there was no means of effectively coordinating policy between the
Member States. When the crisis struck, policy makers decided to
gradually correct the flaws of the original architecture. A considerable
part of that work has been done, though we still need to see much more
action in areas of supranational fiscal policy, system-wide deposit
guarantees, and democratic decision making. Against this backdrop, I
claim that European leaders should have been more ambitious from the
start, should not have built a severely lacking monetary union, and
should have taken tougher political decisions in a timely fashion. These
would have greatly eased the crisis and would have shown that the actual
problem is not with the fiscal rules themselves, but with the prevailing
politics between the Member States.

**B.** So you see the legal framework as more or less neutral?

**A.** No law is truly neutral. It is permeated by a certain
mentality. Still, laws are open to interpretation, while there is
sufficient scope for alternative action. What is needed is political
will. Look at the Commission's recent reflection paper on reforming the
Economic and Monetary Union. It basically admits that they got things
wrong and that Europe should have more tools at its disposal in order to
conduct macroeconomic policy in a fairer, more effective fashion.

**C.** In essence, your view is that neoliberalism is a by-product of
the prevailing politics, not of the rules as such. However, the way I
read such items as the fiscal compact, I find it hard to imagine there
being an alternative to neoliberalism. Hence my argument for exiting the
EU in order to restore national sovereignty.

**A.** All dogmas rest on the premise that there is no alternative to
their own version of the truth. And all dogmas prevail when those who
disagree with them fail to realise that they have internalised the
fiction that there are no alternatives. This then functions as an ex
post facto rationalisation of the tendency to withdraw. Fatalism
engenders nihilism. I cannot subscribe to that view. Politics is about
sovereign will formation. Austerity is not some natural calamity or some
mechanistic process of legal documents. It is the collective decision of
the incumbent politicians. Attack the prevailing mindset on its
specifics. Put forward tangible alternative measures. Vote for those who
want to enact reforms. Whatever you do, recognise that things can be
done differently without waiting for some miracle or the planets to
align.

**B.** The greatest strength of democracy is that it always finds a way
to cope with a problem. And it can always correct past mistakes. Think
about the politics of the euro crisis. The distrust between the
countries of the North and the South, the fact that political thinking
had yet to fully grasp the problem Europe was facing. The decisions
adopted back then were flawed, but there is no one claiming that they
were set in stone. The EMU will be reformed, so it is likely that some
exaggerations will be smoothened.

**C.** That is wishful thinking, because the fiscal compact is here to
stay.

**D.** But it was said earlier that the major flaw of the EMU is that it
is unbalanced. Some policies have already been integrated while social
issues remain fragmented along national lines. I assume you would
suggest that with the entry into force of more measures for
supranational social policy, the invidious effects of austerity will be
ameliorated?

**A.** The idea is to always treat a political phenomenon in its proper
context. To account for its historical drivers and to trace patterns
that point to changes further into the future. Yes, that is basically my
point. The shortcomings of the EMU are in large part due to its
incompleteness. Again though, even once economic and social policy are
integrated at the supranational level, we will still need the right
political leaders to take decisions in the interests of society at
large. The political process is the most important domain. Laws
themselves are not sufficient.

**D.** And avoid sweeping generalisations?

**A.** That too. By the way, and speaking of dogmas, have I ever
described you my epistemological litmus test for engaging in dialectic,
in joint research?

**C.** Keep it short and we should be fine.

**A.** Dialectic is the method of cooperatively arriving at a greater
truth than what either side to the argument initially knew. Participants
in dialectic share a common virtue. They are willing to recognise errors
in their argument and are eager to abandon their view in favour of a
more cogent one. The dialecticians are interested in the truth, not in
"winning the argument". For the dialectician, "losing the argument"
actually means being emancipated from a falsehood, which is a net
positive. Now about the litmus test. If someone has no intention to ever
abandon their view, if their ideas are absolute and perceived as devoid
of any flaw or error, then they lack the epistemological virtue
necessary for dialectic. They simply cannot be argued with. This virtue
is *parrhesia*, or else boldness to speak one's mind and courage to
recognise errors as well as valid points for their intrinsic qualities
instead of who states them.

**D.** So when someone truly believes in the fatalistic notion of
neoliberalism being ingrained in the EU architecture?

**A.** They fail to see that they could further improve their knowledge,
or to escape from their fallacies, were they be willing to engage in
dialectic. In other words to be exposed to a different thinking process,
to conduct further research, and to critically assess their formerly
held position.

**Mr. Biermann.** Sir, you must be fun at parties. Pay the bill
please. I must close the cashier. There is no alternative!

## Conclusion

The *Dialogues on EU politics* is a different take on my corpus of
political analysis. I have used fictional characters to convey my ideas
in a dialogical format. My hope is that the dialogue is more
entertaining to read than a series of essays. Perhaps it also turns out
to be more didactic.

I find the dialogue superior to the essay in at least one important
respect. It makes the thinking process more evident. Apart from the
actual arguments, one can follow along with the rationale. It thus is
possible that readers will arrive at different conclusions than the ones
presented herein. That is a feature of the dialogical format I much
appreciate.

The *Dialogues* is, for the most part, a piece of theoretical work. It
is rather abstract. There are relatively few references to day-to-day
political issues, party politics, and the kind of affairs that influence
the agenda. I think a blog is better suited for technical analyses on
rapidly evolving states of affairs. A book seems more appropriate for
inquiries into the structure of things, the patterns, the qualities that
remain constant or which are less likely to change over extended periods
of time. Bar some allusions to current events, this book can be read in
the summer of 2017 or in 2020 and still be relevant. That is how I would
like it to be.
