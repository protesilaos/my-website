title: "Why I won't join your club"
subtitle: "On the quest for truth and the misplaced expectations of philosophy's output"
excerpt: "A work on philosophy by Protesilaos Stavrou about the quest for truth and the misplaced expectations of philosophy's output."
---

**A.:** We have been through this before and I know you are not an
academic, but I have to try at least one last time: do you want to join
our philosophy club?

**B.:** I rejected it last time, but must have forgotten why.  It was
months ago.  Probably it was because I did not see the point of it.
Perhaps I misunderstood you.  What does this club do?

**A.:** It brings together academics and experts from this region's
universities and leading think tanks.  We read each other's papers, hold
discussions, organise symposia...  You will get the chance to meet new
people, make connections, talk about your real interests.  If anything,
you will have a good time.

**B.:** Ah yes, now I remember!  I recently read one of those papers.
My understanding is that to get a PhD you must make an original
contribution to our stock of knowledge.  To do so, the author was
re-reading some ancient philosopher in light of the latest findings in
science as well as what currently finds currency in professional
philosophy circles.

**A.:** Interesting!  How did you find it?

**B.:** I quit reading after the second or third page.  To be more
precise, I quit after encountering the 20th word with an "-ism" suffix.

**A.:** That's a pity.  Did you find it boring?

**B.:** It felt to me as an internal debate held by some fringe group I
have no connection to.  I don't do philosophy to compare the views of
different authors.  That is a scholarly activity.  It has its purpose,
yet it is not for me.  Contributing to some stock of knowledge sounds
like a laudable pursuit, though I have no notion of what it entails.  I
simply philosophise to satisfy my need for it.  It is a form of a
expression.  If my hands were more nimble I would play the guitar
instead or produce landscape paintings.  But I was born that way, so I
must do what I can.  The gist is that you should not take me too
seriously.  I already forgot what I wrote about two weeks ago: there is
no attempt to be consistent, no ambition to produce yet another "-ism"
or become a scholarch in a brand new school of thought.

**A.:** Maybe that particular paper was not dedicated to a topic of your
interest.  Philosophy is a broad field, after all.  It is normal to
focus on what you like.  At the club we cater to everyone.

**B.:** Say I discover a paper that piques my interest.  What does the
club add to my experience of reading it?

**A.:** Nothing whatsoever.  It merely provides a platform for finding
such works and for connecting with their authors.

**B.:** Suppose I do join you.  What does the club try to achieve?  Is
it to make philosophers sociable, to improve their career prospects,
maybe find them a date?  Or does it have a loftier goal?

**A.:** When you bring people together, lots of opportunities open up.
Though our stated mission is to make progress in philosophy.

**B.:** Progress in philosophy?  What do philosophers care about the
most?  What is the end of philosophy?

**A.:** The truth.  Philosophers want to reveal or at least approximate
the truth.

**B.:** What is the truth?

**A.:** That is the key question!

**B.:** So philosophers search for the truth but cannot even define it
properly?

**A.:** It is why we need to sit down and agree on the fundamentals.
Then we can build up from there.  Currently everyone has their own
views.  We cannot proceed without consensus.

**B.:** You are my friend.  I must speak my mind and tell you why I have
zero interest in attending your club's gatherings.  It all starts with
philosophy's quest for the truth.  Philosophers should have learnt by
now that they can only define the truth negatively by using all the
faculties at their disposal to rule out what feels wrong.  Though the
problem is that one cannot be certain of their attempts at disproving
falsehoods because there is no benchmark with which to assess individual
propositions.  To know what the criterion is, to be certain about it, is
to have found a particular aspect of the truth.  But to claim as much is
a positive proposition, which itself is subject to falsification.

**A.:** You just outlined the core issue.  No wonder then that
philosophy cannot give us any tangible results.

**B.:** What results do you expect?  There are no results in the sense
of reaching a terminus to a given research programme.  I think of the
philosopher as an antipode to hubris, to human's propensity to step
outside their limits and inflict harm on their own or on others.  The
philosopher reminds people that their designs and stratagems, their bold
claims on wisdom and virtue, their delusions of grandeur, are far more
fragile and ephemeral than they think.  Life is like the reverie of a
goddess.  One moment you are walking, suddenly you collapse on the
floor: the end.

**A.:** I was thinking that philosophy could help us do things better,
like improve how we do science...

**B.:** Some professors of philosophy would definitely like to assume
that kind of role: to issue instructions to other experts about how they
should conduct themselves.  To me that is not what philosophy is about,
for how can one tell others in sincerity what is the right course of
action when they themselves understand that the truth remains elusive?
I can't teach the Stephen Hawkings of this world, those who think that
philosophy is dead, how to approach scientific problems.  That would be
presumptuous and ultimately false.  All I can contribute is a friendly
reminder that their pride, inflated self-importance and sense of
accomplishment, are not peculiar to them.  Others have also entertained
those fancies.  They were all proven to be mistaken in one way or
another.  Again, this is all about acting as a check against cockiness.

Scientism](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-04-28-notes-science-scientism/)
(2021-04-28) ]

**A.:** This puzzles me.  On the one hand you suggest that philosophy
has a role to play as a social service of some sort, yet on the other I
get the feeling that you are not particularly enthusiastic about the
whole enterprise.  Do you think there is something missing?  Could it be
that the study of philosophical themes is in vain?  Why do all leading
universities have philosophy departments then?

**B.:** Well, in our country and many others around the globe higher
education is a lucrative industry with strong ties to big business and
other centres of power.  Why it does certain things is not strictly
about some selfless commitment to the service of an ideal of scientific
enlightenment or whatnot.  We have reached a point of heightened
prejudice where one's titles and certificates matter more than what they
actually say.  Ex officio wisdom is nothing new, though now it has
become a commodity where students are encouraged or forced by immense
social pressure and the structural demands of the workplace to assume
odious debt burdens in pursuit of a degree; a degree that will get them
a bullshit job that will ultimately barely service interest payments.
To join a university is fast becoming a bondage to the creditor: a
Faustian bargain.  But I digress, as the point is whether the study of
philosophy is in vain.  One could ask what isn't, though I understand
your club thinks that at least its presence is worthwhile.  Let us grant
that some things are worthy in their own right and are so absolutely.
The thing is that philosophy cannot be one's primary or only interest in
learning.  You must live your life in full and do philosophy to help you
remain anchored in the actuality of your being, which is one of
uncertainty.  We learn about uncertainty not through intense
philosophical work, but by everyday experience.

**A.:** What is wrong with specialising in philosophy?

**B.:** The same that is typically bad with every other
over-specialisation: you view the world through the narrow lenses of
that field, you are indoctrinated in its thinking, you are alienated
from your self as you try to become that which is considered canonical
among your peers.  Then your social life is aligned with that
role-playing, which inevitably reinvigorates the cycle of
indoctrination.  You pick sides and become team "idealism", "realism",
or whatever "-ism" is trendy or whichever has persuaded you to join its
ranks.  I find that neither interesting nor fecund.  I would rather
assess an argument on its own merits than by reference to some
overarching framework or tacit authority.  You can waste your time
trying to solve thought experiments, like those which ask you to imagine
you are just a mind.  I assume there is something exciting about finding
answers to those tricky questions.  Though my take would be to take a
step back, relax, and just admit that you are an actual animal and all
those years as a fully fledged human have already conditioned you to act
and think in certain ways.  You are a corporeal entity, with both reason
and emotions, with organs that contribute to different types of
experiences.  An experience is something you know, because you have
already been through it multiple times.  Same for intuitions which
extend that which has already been rendered clear by the senses.  How
can I imagine I am something non-human when half way through the
supposed experiment my body tells me that it needs water, my legs feel
numb after many hours of sitting on the chair, and so on?  I am
constantly reminded of the absurdity of the proposition.  There is more
to life than philosophy.  Don't let it trick you into thinking that by
becoming a philosopher you are joining some special class reserved for
intelligent people.  Those who are truly smart understand that smartness
is not a function of their preoccupation.

**A.:** Is not reason the defining characteristic of humankind?

**B.:** I don't know.  Have you ever met such a human?

**A.:** Yes, people can be reasonable.

**B.:** No, not like that.  I am interested in the "defining
characteristic".  Philosophers will have you believe that you are a
fraction of human or that you have a standalone presence of some sort
that is distinct from the rest of totality: an exalted being governed by
reason, the chimera of the _homo economicus_, a decontextualised
individual with unchecked free will, and so on depending on the "-ism".
What a culture takes for granted at the fundamental level, be it
property rights, the idea of "natural" law (a contradiction in terms),
the binary of reward and punishment, anthropocentrism, and anything else
typically is the work of some philosopher who forgot to point to the
fact of their pervasive uncertainty.  The philosopher must be aware that
others are listening and must assume responsibility in the same way the
physician must commit to do no harm on their patient who trusts them
with their life.

**A.:** How do we escape from those conventional truths?

**B.:** There is no single way to go about it.  Sometimes you just
stumble across an article that is critical of an institution and you
start unravelling the whole apparatus.  Other times it may be because of
a profound experience where, for example, you walk up a mountain top,
perhaps by serendipity or the guidance of Demeter (Earth Mother) or
whatever you want to bring up as an explanation.  While at that
altitude, you are in awe at the sheer scale and interconnectedness of
the world.  You realise how grand life is far beyond your comprehension,
even by staring into the otherwise limited horizon.  Those trees around
you, the bees, the grass, the clouds, the rock you stand on, the orbit
of the moon and the position of the Sun, and a seemingly infinite array
of mutually dependent factors are all preconditions for your existence
and continuous presence.  At which point you admit to be yet another
tiny piece in this system of systems of systems of emergent realities
that we call the cosmos.  And then you can't help but laugh out loud at
how preposterous the concept of a human-centred universe is.

**A.:** Is reason overrated then?

**B.:** Reason is the faculty we employ to add order to our impressions
and extend their application.  It has its purpose and should be rated
appropriately.  Though reason is not a substitute for everything that is
human.  Unless your career hinges on forwarding such an agenda.  As
Michelle Gurevich says in _Kiss_ "Let's kiss and see what happens".  No
amount of thinking will ever give you the experience of a kiss or indeed
of anything never encountered before.  Each one can be unique.  No book
or library will suffice.  And no reductive exercise will help either,
such as by simplifying the human being as nothing but biochemistry, for
that ignores the emergent reality of the conscious experience, the
actuality of the supersystem of subsystems of biochemistry understood as
human.

(2021-05-07) ]

**A.:** Interesting that you bring up Michelle Gurevich!  All those
songs are wonderfully honest and insightful.  I have been listening to
them ever since you shared them with me: _No One Answer_, _Party Girl_,
_Almost Shared a Lifetime_, _Show Me The Face_, _Lovers are Strangers_,
_Blue Eyes Unchanged_, _First Six Months of Love_, _Life Is Coming Back
to Me_...  I could go on.  Beautiful!  Your point then is that the
philosopher must perform their social function towards philosophy
itself, otherwise an exaggerated opinion about the human condition might
lead us down the wrong path.  Right?

**B.:** Indeed, that is my point.  Alluding to a singer and songwriter
is no coincidence.  One can learn so much from a single song, including
the recognition that their field of interest is not necessarily superior
to all the rest.  When you are exposed to art, when you walk in the
forest, whenever you let go of pretences in intimate relationships, you
discover something about your self, the human kind, the world around
you.  As for philosophy, we must keep things in perspective.  The
philosopher does not have all the answers.  Philosophy is a disposition
towards knowledge and learning which basically comes down to remaining
open to the possibility of being proven wrong and being elated about
such a prospect for it emancipates you from the powerful grip of a
falsehood.  To my mind, the philosopher reminds people that they can be
mistaken in their beliefs and that they are mere mortals.

**A.:** Could philosophy then be considered a kind of therapy?

**B.:** Perhaps, though likening it to what physicians do might give the
wrong impression.  Philosophy is one of the many fields of endeavour
that can help you avoid excesses in life.  Why would we think that a
philosopher is more truthful than an artist or a scientist?  That aside,
the "therapy" you are alluding to is an escape from dogma.  When you
understand that you do not really know all that much, and when you
realise the immanence of uncertainty, you stop worrying about
appearances.  Just like Socrates, you know that you do not know, even
though others in your milieu are making a luxurious living out of
essential lies about their abilities.

**A.:** What does it mean to avoid excesses?  Where do we draw the line?

**B.:** Just as with the concept of "truth", we can only imagine it as a
negative space that is delineated from what we do recognise.  When you
witness someone boasting about their power, you cannot help but hint at
their fragility.  Diogenis of Sinope (the Cynic) did just that when
Alexander, the so-called "Great", confronted him.  The aspiring hegemon
of the Earth asked the philosopher what did he want from the sovereign,
to which Diogenis replied in splendid Cynical fashion: to enlighten him
or, in other words, to not blot out the light as Alexander was standing
between him and the Sun.  The intent is to remind the despot not to
bring darkness upon humanity.  There is nothing great about Alexanders.
Ruling the world will not make you superhuman.  You still are an
ordinary Alexander with the same needs for sustenance as everybody else,
the same fears and insecurities, the same hopes and desires.  Why should
your empire control access to a common resource, when we can just live
without its mediation?  What makes you special, you fool!?

**A.:** Okay, take tyranny as a case in point.  If philosophers do not
know what the truth is, how can they or anyone make a value judgement
against tyranny or, indeed, any other form of government or type of
social organisation?

**B.:** We may not know what the absolute best system is, but we can
still consider tyranny inadequate for a broad range of likely states of
affairs because a single person, or a few of them, cannot possibly
design policies that cater to the diverse needs and aspirations of their
subjects.  Be it by viciousness, ignorance, pride, vanity, they will do
more harm than good.  They lack insight into the particularities of each
case and, depending on how large the scale of operations is, are too
disconnected from the quotidian life of people under their rule.  As
always, this is not a purely philosophical take: we base it on our
experience.  Indeed, the idea of a "purely philosophical" claim is
suspect as it hearkens back to those figments of the imagination that
philosophers entertain while carrying out their experiments.

transnationalism](https://protesilaos.com/politics/2021-05-29-nation-state-democracy-transnationalism/)
(2021-05-29) ]

**A.:** How do you filter out wrong systems though?  What is the
criterion?

**B.:** The same can be said of the proponents of those systems.  Why
should Alexander rule over the world?  What is his justification?  We
will find that we are in doubt and so we must default to a mode of
conduct that minimises the chance of errors with far-reaching
implications into areas of activity beyond their particular domain.  The
likeliness of failure for a single, central node is greater than
multiple failures over smaller, distributed nodes, ceteris paribus.  We
know this not by means of experimentation _in vitro_, but through
everyday experience.  You put all the eggs in one basket for the sake of
convenience and now you stand to lose everything at once.  You engage in
monocultural farming to optimise short-term yields and are inevitably
eroding the sustainability of the local ecosystem, thus creating much
greater perils for the future.  Remember that philosophy does not have
answers.  It is a state of mind about not taking yourself too seriously.

**A.:** I see.  Don't you think it would be better if those ideas were
given a platform so that more people can access them?

**B.:** Popularity is not a reliable sign of quality.  Then we have the
substantive aspect of philosophy.  Have you ever tried to lead a
discussion towards more theoretical themes?  People opt to change the
subject or lose interest really fast.  The philosopher is destined to
isolation and self-imposed exile, at least insofar as the act of
philosophising is concerned.  You should count yourself lucky to ever be
in the company of a like-minded person and to also enjoy their presence
beyond the narrow confines of a shared interest.  Amplifying a signal
does not mean it will be heard amid the cacophony of noise.

you](https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-06-05-why-you-never-call-me/)
(2021-06-05) ]

**A.:** So how do you reach out to kindred spirits?

**B.:** Maybe your club knows better.  I don't try to reach out to
anyone.  My work is just the result of an internal need or impetus to
act.

**A.:** Why publish it then?

**B.:** To resist the temptation of curating myself.  To make something
public is a commitment to stand by its substantive claims.  If you are
wrong, you will be the first to criticise yourself by means of a new
publication that contradicts the previous ones.  Others will notice that
there is no beautification at play.  If I was peddling some school of
thought, if I had a niche in mind, then maybe I would be behaving
differently.  Though I will leave that as an exercise for your club's
members: what would you be doing if you were not who you are?  It will
fit right in.

**A.:** I appreciate your honesty.  Should the philosopher always be
honest?

**B.:** Honesty towards oneself is part of the philosophical enterprise
of remaining open to the possibility of being proven wrong.  Though this
is not generalisable.  Sometimes in life you must pretend not to know to
protect others from their destructive propensities.

**A.:** So you tell them lies?

**B.:** No, not necessarily.  You ask them questions about their
approach.  Guide them towards realising what their disposition is.  Peel
off the hardened outermost layers.  Let them believe that what you would
have suggested at the outset was their own thought all along.  It is
their struggle to escape from falsehoods.  You should not interfere with
it, as dogma creates its own self-defence mechanisms to the point where
people do not take kindly to criticism and what are perceived as
exhortations.  Sometimes honesty engenders adverse effects and, in our
case, can make the dogma more deeply embedded.

**A.:** Does this work though?  I find that people simply cling on to
their preconceived notions.

**B.:** When that does not produce the desired results, you need to
convey the message another way and stand firm.  Here is a story that
inspired me to do so on a permanent basis.  Once I attended a social
gathering with a bunch of strangers.  Not out of my own volition: it was
part of a job.  I was normally clean shaven, but it happened on a Sunday
evening, so I had remained unshaven since Friday morning.  Once I
arrived at my destination, someone remarked that I looked like a
terrorist, to which I replied that they sound like a moron.  Apart from
the racist stereotype, I thought this was an opportunity to put people
into second thoughts before they even utter a word.  So I started
growing a full beard ever since: make them a bit uncomfortable, let them
challenge their prejudices, allow them to get to terms with that which
they consider alien, and ultimately learn something about themselves
without ever admitting to it.  Help them grow out of their narrow-minded
self.

**A.:** I am sorry for what you had to endure.

**B.:** No worries!  When you understand where people are coming from,
you do not harbour hard feelings about anything they may say.  Here's
another story just to cheer you up and to show you a third approach.  A
few years ago I was at a shop near a popular pilgrimage site.  I was
sporting a beard and long hair.  Was fairly well dressed that day.
Nothing fancy, just not particularly attractive and certainly not flashy
or trendy.  At some point, I noticed another customer about twice my age
looking at me.  I did not do anything about it, though I kept my eyes
peeled.  After seemingly overcoming their internal conflict, they
started moving towards my position, with a body language that
communicated a mixture of curiosity and hesitation.  "Excuse me, dear
sir...".  I welcomed them politely as they paused for a moment.  "Do you
have any connection to holiness?".  I understood they mistook me for a
local priest or a monk, so I replied "Perhaps I do.  Do they?" while
nodding towards the direction of the pilgrimage site.  All I got in
return was a puzzled and silent face.

**A.:** One must do whatever it takes, I guess.  What do you think is a
practical advise to help people be more philosophical in terms of not
taking themselves too seriously and trying to be rigorous about
questioning their thoughts?

**B.:** To change their mindset about their perceived helplessness.
Every child likes to be spoon-fed but at some point the parent must put
an end to it so that the child can assume its own agency.  It may seem
harsh, but it comes from a place of love.  Your task must be to give
people resources they could use and to show them how they can be pieced
together.  Just enough to get them started.  Don't try to spoon-feed
them, for that condemns them to their current state, whereas you want
them to grow out of it.

**A.:** This relates to the zeitgeist of doing things quickly and
effortlessly.  It is practically everywhere.  Just the other day, I was
searching for tips with which to improve my sourdough bread technique.
Most resources would be the clickbait type.  Pure garbage!

**B.:** The causes of such phenomena are likely complex and relate to
how society is currently organised, the available technology with its
inherent sets of incentives, the underlying system of values, and so on.
It goes to show, however, how curiosity alone is not enough.  You need
commitment to the cause.  That is the case with every area of expertise.
I am curious about music and painting, but unless I put some serious
effort into them, and provided I have the requisite talents, no shortcut
will ever take me to the point of being an accomplished artist.  Again,
this is what the philosopher is trying to say: don't delude yourself
into thinking that you have found a way to bend the rules of life.  The
procrastinator who expects immediate results by following some
supposedly magic formula is committing hubris, for they do not recognise
their condition and, thus, their limits.  Unless they change their ways,
they will suffer.

**A.:** How do you go about leading a philosophy-inspired lifestyle in
an era where success is contingent on the appearance of unflinching
certainty?

**B.:** It is not just the present age.  Humans have always pretended to
know more than they do.  There is no compromise to be had.  You let go
of the presumption that success matters for doing philosophy.  What
difference does it make to me if one or a hundred people read this?  It
still says the same things.  Furthermore, when you have an audience and
put yourself in the role of preaching to them, you lose the freedom of
expression in a substantive sense as you cannot upset them by changing
your mind about a given issue.  They are not ready for it.  This too is
a way to communicate a philosophical insight: don't make any claims on
consistency, do not promise coherence, do not even suggest that what you
propose is remotely plausible.  Put the reader in a position where they
have to be reminded not to take things at face value.  Those who follow
along do it at their own risk.

**A.:** Still, I can't let go of the intuition that being appreciated by
some people is better than getting no feedback at all.  Just imagine
joining our club and delivering a presentation on what we have discussed
today.  You could get a round of applause and then be invited to mingle
with people where you can further elaborate on your views.

**B.:** You conveniently left out the dating part.  Regardless, being
recognised is always nice.  Humans are easily flattered.  Though once
the lights fade you realise it was all in vain.  Recognition or the lack
thereof does not affect your experience with philosophy itself.  It is
its own end, not a means towards becoming popular with some club's
members or the public at-large.  This telos is not necessarily
significant for humanity, at least not for me, as I pursue it solely out
of an inner need.

**A.:** Okay, let's leave it at that.  I still have to finish my tea.
You won't be joining our club after all...

**B.:** Actually I changed my mind: I will join you as soon as you
achieve progress in philosophy.  Good luck with that!
