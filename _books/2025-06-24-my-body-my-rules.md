In this ~33-minute video, I comment on the theme of "my body; my
rules." At the face of it, this idea makes sense. Though it is
incomplete because it does not cover the consequences of one's
actions. I then explain how we have to factor in responsibility and
the idea of sustainability. In the video, I also comment on the
article of Poppy Sowerby for _UnHerd_ magazine with the title "When
Andrew Tate met Bonnie Blue":
