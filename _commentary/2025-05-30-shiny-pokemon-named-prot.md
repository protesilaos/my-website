Hahaha, that is amazing!

No, I do not find it weird. On the contrary, this is something special
which you care about. I am honoured. Thank you!

Also, I think this is a cute story that I should publish on my
website. I will copy the exchange (your message and my reply), but
will leave out your personal information. Are you okay with this?

> The shiny Pokemon was Aron, by the way. It's one of my favorites.

Looks great! I admit that I have not kept up with the newer
generations. I like the ones in Super Smash Bros, especially Greninja
and Mewtwo.
