title: "Writing to refine my ideas and discover new ones"
excerpt: "An entry from my journal where I explain my emotional disposition for writing with consistency."

This is taken from my journal.

* * *

I write to understand my ideas better. It is the verbal equivalent of
drawing a chart to visualise some data. Ideas that stay in my head
remain disjointed until they wither away. When I set out to express
something, I do it with the intent of testing its viability.

The very process of writing is creative because of the feelings it
engenders. Whether some concept feels right or wrong ultimately does
not matter, as both inspire further thinking. The former begets
coherent sequences of thoughts, while the latter calls for a review.
We can think of those as modes of being that are necessary at
different stages. There is fermentation, when things are propagating
and bubbling up, and distillation, when the excess parts must be
removed and what remains shall be reduced to its essentials. It is not
about having one or the other, but understanding the flow wherein one
becomes the other.

For me, what works best is to think about something for a while before
committing it to a file. There are thoughts that register once but do
not stick around. I have learnt not to capture everything as soon as
it enters the periphery of my conscience, but instead to allow it to
prove its potential worth by exhibiting the quality of persistence.
If some idea lingers around, then I act on it. As such, I do not
collect ephemeral wishes or poorly considered projects. Very little
among the totality of what goes through my head survives.

I find that keeping things with no obvious value around is cognitively
burdensome. When I plan my agenda, I only record the genuinely
time-sensitive tasks. Those are the meetings I have to attend and any
real deadlines I must meet. Everything else is an entry to my
wishlist. I keep the wishlist under control. If some task is there for
years, then I am most likely never going to do it. More so if I
completely forgot what I was even thinking about it and its connection
to the wider corpus of my work. In practice, I have learnt to
anticipate such eventualities, so I will not even capture the original
task. Thus I prevent bad projects from crowding out the good ones.

The point is that I blithely remove stuff. I will even delete journal
entries that I diligently wrote but no longer consider useful. Most of
those that are worth paying attention to end up on my website where I
will likely never read them again. The only reason I publish them is
because I imagine someone out there may have a use for them. It is
like carefully placing an unneeded yet perfectly functional piece of
furniture on the side of the road instead of destroying it. There is a
neighbour who can benefit from that item.

The publications on my website are for others. I have no need for
them. What I gained from the process of piecing them together is
engraved in my brain as the cerebral equivalent of a beaten path. I
traversed those trails, found the most efficient connections, and
cleared all the intermediate obstacles. The integration of ideas that
have been fleshed out is akin to connecting a road to the network. In
this regard, I benefit from the fact that most of what I deal with is
not sensitive to detail. I only need a small datum to derive the
whole.

Decluttering my head helps me stay nimble and preserve mental space
for the formation of novel thoughts and the refinement of existing
ones. I do not feel attached to my works. Likening them to children
("my brainchild") is not a helpful metaphor as I am not emotionally
invested in their wellness. I treat my publications as fellow
travellers I met at the port and with whom I shall part ways amicably.

In a manner of speaking, I travel with nothing but a suitcase. It
contains some clothes and the irreducible tools of my craft (well,
this is actually how I always travelled as I literally do not keep
mementos or any extra stuff). The rest is generated on the spot.
Consistent with this lightness is the manner in which I discover
derivative thoughts, given a certain impetus. I have a basic concept
in mind and start working on it without knowing exactly what I will
produce. For example, the idea for this very essay existed long ago as
a series of connected dots formed through prior explorations. Now I am
drawing finer lines in the space they delineate without knowing
exactly what kind of image those will reveal. My focus right now is on
the micro level. This idea proceeds from the previous one and triggers
the next one. Once I am done writing, I will take a step back and
appreciate the macro view. The outline emerges from the body of text,
not the other way around. The snapshot of this bigger picture will be
imprinted in my head and I will move on to the next project.

I am not in it for the end result. The process of discovery is what
drives me. I embark with my boat on the high seas not knowing which
shore I will end up on, trusting that Atlas, this titanic mountain
range, will continue to uphold my open horizons. I create "alla
prima", a concept I borrow from the history of art where painters
choose to apply oil paint on canvas and refine it only while the paint
is wet. No further refinement is done on top of dry paint. The result
is one that at some level surprises even its creator. This means that
I do my work in one go or, put differently, in a condensed state of
flow while all the connections are fresh in my mind. I do not dwell on
an essay for several days. If I cannot produce it outright, then the
fermentation in my head is not completed. I have to wait for longer
and only then proceed to distil what has taken form.

The Greek artists used to begin with an appeal to the Muses, the
patrons of the arts, letters, and sciences: for them to whisper words
that may then be expressed through the media of human communication.
This is a helpful metaphor for what inspiration entails. When I am
elaborating on something without a complete view of its end state I am
in effect transcribing the message of the goddess as it reaches my
ears. This way, I admit that "my works" are a reconfiguration and
amplification of the stimuli I have been exposed to filtered through
the mechanisms inherent to me, which themselves were and are
conditioned by the factors specific to their case. To claim ownership
over a given thing is to imply that the environment which made it
possible is mine too and so on for its environment.

Muses being the authors is the other side of the aforementioned
lightness. These are not my brainchildren. I am no more partial to
them than to anything I have ever echoed or mimicked. The enjoyment I
get out of creativity is all about having presence in my present. I
work with what I have and express it without fear of being judged.

Writers hit a block when their conscience is pulled in multiple
directions. In effect, they are not mentally at the locus they occupy.
These distractions come in the form of competing thoughts that
struggle to come to the surface all at once. They are the product of
overexposure to stimuli, of rising the temperature too much which
accelerates fermentation past the point of viability. They may also
arise as concerns about eventualities and potential outcomes, such as
the worry of being trolled for something to be published. There has
been no publication and no resulting trolling reaction, yet the very
notion of it hogs the stage at present time, leaving no room for
pertinent thoughts to be expressed.

What others think is not relevant to the publication I am making.
Their comments come ex post facto: the work is already done and I have
moved on to the next one. I am thus not bothered by the past. If
something I wrote is wrong, then all I can do is hope that my future
self will have a more refined hearing capacity to better interpret
what the Muses are disseminating. I cannot go back and undo what has
transpired. I must take it as-is. Worrying about it is a waste of my
finite vitality.

With regard to potentially negative comments, I am not disturbed by
them. Once we abstract away from their particularities, what they do
performs a vital function of reminding one not to cling on to their
thoughts. If some comment bothers you, then it tells you a vital truth
that you keep avoiding: you are standing on precarious ground. The
reason for such weakness comes down to an asymmetry of power where you
have grown attached to something, wishing it to be an extension of
your self, even though you have no such power over it. Sensitivity
then is the flip-side of your powerlessness to integrate with it. You
need somebody to remind you that what you are doing is accumulate
burdens on your conscience; burdens that may only bog you down.

Besides, the vast majority of comments are not substantive. If what
you publish is superficial, then you will receive more reactions,
ceteris paribus, due to the low barrier to entry. A 1-minute video
will gain more full views than a 2-hour video. It takes less of a
commitment to watch the former than the latter. Similarly, a
mainstream topic will attract more attention than a niche one. If the
material demands a higher level of concentration, which happens when
you elaborate at length and specialise, you are effectively ruling out
opportunistic commentary. Or, if you do still receive something
generic, you know it is not worth your time.

If, then, there are comments despite the high barrier to entry, you
can expect them to be fruitful, even when they are negative. The
commentator is putting in the effort to make sense of your labour and
is giving you something in return. Do not dread such a scenario. Learn
to let go of what needs to be left behind and to pursue what continues
to elude you.

Consistent creativity is necessarily underpinned by mental fortitude.
I am untouchable because an attack on my works can only target a
position I no longer hold. What may be visible there is but a trace of
where I once was. My strength consists in not identifying with any of
those mirages found in my corpus of work. I carry nothing surplus to
requirements. With no burdens to slow me down, I am ever in motion
even when things get rough. I experience no writer's block as my
momentum powers through any barrier.

At its core, this is an emotional disposition of remaining committed
to the journey while standing aloof from its destinations. I know that
I can set out to sail the seas, but I cannot control where the
vicissitudes of this world's phenomena will take me. I am subject to
them and take whatever comes my way. If I wanted a specific outcome
and I was ultimately disappointed it did not happen, I am reminded
about the error of my ways. Why would I even believe that the world
would bend to my will when I am fully aware that I have no power over
it? We set ourselves up for failure when we hinge our hopes and
self-worth on a specific outcome.

Fundamentally, I do what my condition renders inescapable. I have
accepted what is and do not suffer from what cannot become. As I am
creating this, I feel compelled to also record feelings in the
following poem, titled "Mermaid" (I will also publish it separately in
[the Poems section of my website](https://protesilaos.com/poems/).

```
Mermaid

It is Alexander's sister
who emerges from the seabed
to warn wanton sailors
that exotic landscapes
shall not free them
from the ocean's spell
```
