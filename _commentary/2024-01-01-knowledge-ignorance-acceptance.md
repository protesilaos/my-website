Sure, I am happy to help however I can. In short:

- The pursuit of knowledge is fine, provided you do not feel inhibited
  by the absence of knowledge. A common example of self-induced
  powerlessness is the scientist who voices no opinion on what is
  happening around them on the premise that "I am not an expert", then
  suffers from political decisions with a direct effect on their
  science. Who are the experts in politics? Why must we think in terms
  of all or nothing and choose nothing?

- No matter how knowledgeable you are, you will never have perfect
  insight. Forget about theoretical issues and think about everyday
  stuff, such as finding a pet dog: you cannot learn everything about
  the specific animal before living with it. All you can do in the
  beginning is start with the fairly limited knowledge you have, trust
  that it will work, and learn as you go. Our choices in life come
  with a degree of uncertainty and so we must accept the fact that we
  are always partially relying on our beliefs/faith to fill in the
  blanks.

- As for pedantry, you will feel free once you learn to ignore it and
  not do it to others. The expression "sod off" is an excellent way to
  deal with pedants.

I imagine there are lots of fields where people work in them without
being enthusiastic about them. It has to do with the fact that "it's
just a job". There are practical reasons to pick a profession. Though
yes, when not many people care, the working environment can be
uninspiring.

The point though is that you do not control the prevailing conditions.
You can try to change them, perhaps together with others, though the
odds are against you. If you are disappointed by how things stand, you
must either learn to tolerate this state of affairs or find something
else that does not drain you of your vitality. This goes back to the
point of lacking perfect knowledge: when you _feel_ really bad about
something, consider trusting your body and don't wait too long for
some irrefutable personalised truth to be revealed to you, since in
practice you do not have the luxury to wait.

You are right. Though this is not an Internet-only phenomenon. If you
ever go to a village café, you will find non-techie people who (i) are
too opinionated about topics they know nothing about, while (ii)
constantly switch topics as soon as you try to go a bit deeper. I
guess people prefer to take it easy when they can.

Same idea for the "claiming without knowing" part. Socrates was
pointing this out in ancient Athens, for example (relevant comment of
mine, though it assumes some familiarity with the topic:
<https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2023-07-25-comments-socrates-apology/>).

I am pointing these out to suggest that we better not have too high
expectations about what people should be doing. If we are disappointed
and/or frustrated about such a common issue, we will keep
encountering it again and again without the power to stop it. The
solution is, again, to tolerate what we perceive as imperfection and
work with what we have.

> I've found me struggling to accept myself.

Many of my comments are on the theme of acceptance. It is about
recognising how things stand, not how we would like them to be. Such
recognition extends to our self, where we acknowledge what we can and
cannot affect. Without acceptance, we suffer because there is a
misalignment between our idealised view of the world and its
actuality. Put simply, we are on the right path when we accept that we
are all human and that what we imagine is true for angels is only true
for them, not us.

If you think about it, it is likely that most people are wrong about
most things. Suppose you survey a 100 random folks on an engineering
issue you are an expert in: their average opinion does not really
matter to you because you still know better.

Finding niche communities and, generally, not going with the majority
is not a problem per se. The tricky part is to make those choices
while remaining open-minded. For example, you choose Emacs because you
like it right now, but still do not want to be fanatical about it: if,
say, a NeoVim user shows you a workflow that is better than the Emacs
equivalent, you acknowledge as much. Otherwise, all is good.

The pitfall with niche topics is that you may become one-dimensional
if you are too invested in them. Try to learn more about general
issues in the world around you. They will help you keep things in
perspective and thus remain open-minded. It also is good to have
varied interests as you can connect better with people while also have
more diverse stimuli for your intuition.

Caring can be a good thing because it shows you are sensitive to what
is happening around you. The key, however, is to care with moderation,
i.e. to recognise the "too much" and know it is harmful. This is easy
to say, but hard to do. Be mindful of it though and try to practice
where possible.
