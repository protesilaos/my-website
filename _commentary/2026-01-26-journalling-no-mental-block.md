title: "Journalling without the mental block"
excerpt: "An essay on how I manage to write consistently even if I have to circumvent mental blocks."
---

I write regularly. This helps me clear my thoughts. I understand
myself better. Each time I expound on a given theme, I deepen all the
mental paths that lead to it. This is exactly how it works in the
physical world around us: the more we tread a path, the denser the
soil gets and thus no vegetation grows there. The path becomes clear.
The absence of plants is a metaphor for the clarity of concept we have
achieved and the ease with which we can access it.

Writing makes me feel calm. It removes all concerns and distractions.
This is a consequence of focusing on the task at hand. While
elaborating on this essay, I cannot also process with equal
effectiveness all other stimuli that demand attention. Irrelevant
thoughts I could otherwise entertain are pushed to the side. I cannot
pull them to the centre of my conscience while also trying to make
this blog entry happen. In other words, I benefit from the fact that I
am not good at multitasking: I just do one thing well, which is to
produce this sequence of letters.

Doing this also puts me in control. I slow down my experience to a
pace that is natural for my current activity. When I am exposed to,
say, the news cycle, I sense that the information world is speeding
away from me. Everything changes so fast, I cannot keep up with it,
and I either surrender to constant distraction or feel stressed and
disempowered. When I write or, generally, when I proceed out of my
initiative, I maintain my balance. My poise is perfect. My progress
inexorable.

I can find other good reasons to write, such as to keep a record of
the little things that happen to me on a daily basis. Personally, I do
not take note of the trivia, such as what I ate earlier or all the
details that kept me busy. I prefer to capture impressions. Those are
the abstractions I derive from multiple phenomena. I discern in them
that which they have in common, as it was imprinted in my mind.

Whether one chooses to be detail-oriented or not is secondary to the
function of a journal as a device for retrospection. We have data
points that help us piece together a narrative of our life as it was
happening.

The contents of one's journal are largely irrelevant, so long as they
experience at least some of the aforementioned. My journalling is
mostly philosophy without the overthinking. It reveals an integral
part of my personality. I like sincerity and the ordinary lad.
Anything that looks or sounds deep and expects subordination
ultimately fails to amuse me. Think of the dog who will pee at the
tire of a cheap motorcycle and a luxurious car with equal disregard
for social sensitivities and role-playing. Once you get that picture
in your head, you gain insight into my worldview: when something is
shallow, I do not treat it as if it is profound.

The point of journalling is to create an outlet for honesty. I happen
to publish almost all of my writings (except those that contain
details of people and places). I do this because it is "hard mode" at
the emotional level and I have a highly competitive side that I need
to keep happy. Journal entries will typically be private. The outlet
for honesty is thus safe: nobody should know what you believe about
yourself, what you feel in those moments, and so on.

No matter the specifics, the key is to gradually develop a habit of
writing with regularity. In this regard, quantity beats quality. Focus
on expressing as much as you can, with a frequency that is high yet
sustainable (doing too much too quickly will not last long). In a
similar spirit, try to write without succumbing to perfectionism. Let
the typos stay there and keep things close to their original form.
Your mistakes are a reminder of your imperfection. They keep you
honest and grounded.

Which brings us to the heart of the issue: writing is hard. If you
have never done it before, you may underestimate how difficult it is
to put your thoughts in a coherent order. It is even harder to arrange
them in a manner that is both enjoyable and informative or persuasive.
The best pieces of writing are those that inspire us to become a
better version of who we are. We may say that they touch our soul in
what might as well be pure magic. The rest we forget about.

As a beginner, you should not have high hopes about the quality of
your output. It will be awkward and clumsy. This is fine. Think of the
baby that makes its first steps. It lacks grace in its motions. Do not
feel ashamed that your baby steps are sloppy. This is nature: it just
is. To judge your preliminary works as "bad" it is to misunderstand
them.

What should I be writing about? This is a question whose answer will
change depending on your experience. In day one, the only answer that
should compel you into action is "anything; just write about anything
you feel like". This too may be vague though, so let me tell you how I
did it.

When I experienced the mental block many years ago I pictured the
following scenario: I am in the middle of nowhere and am asking where
should I go, but I have not even taken the time to describe what is
around me. I am looking too far ahead while completely ignoring
whatever is in front of me. In other words, my priority should be to
identify what my immediate condition is. I must be able to describe my
surroundings. Once I have situational awareness, I can broaden the
scope to cover a few metres further away from where I stand. And then
I will slowly move around, to cautiously explore the space. After
every few steps, I will repeat the exercise of acquainting myself with
my milieu. Eventually, I will grow in confidence to quickly understand
what is happening and to easily relocate without jeopardising my
safety.

This scenario helped me understand that before figuring out what I
wanted to focus on, I needed to appreciate the circumstances I was
operating in. Otherwise I could not anticipate the next steps and get
a sense of whether my longer-term goals were realistic.

Concretely, you should write about anything that comes to mind. The
easiest, I think, is to describe how you feel right now, what is in
your vicinity, how your day went, and the like. Imagine someone you
care about calls you on the phone and asks you how was your day: you
will say more than one sentence, right? Then do the same with your
journal entries: report on what is happening, however inadequate the
delivery is.

Once you practice this for long enough, e.g. for six months, you can
start adding comments on the more technical or specialised topics that
are of interest to you. If, for example, you wish to one day have a
blog about programming, you can introduce an aside on, say, Emacs
Lisp, and then connect it to something that is part of the immediate
reality you have been journalling about. Remember that you are still
reporting on things to someone who is not exactly like you, so you
want to stay away from the technicalities. You are not writing a paper
for an academic audience. Keep it simple.

From the next paragraph onward I provide an example which is true to
the spirit of my original entries. My style back then was different.
Words did not come as easily as they do now and each statement was
unrefined. Still, this example is how I made the breakthrough. Use it
as inspiration to get into the habit of writing. Do not worry if
expressions do not flow as easily as you would like. Also, do not make
the mistake of judging your text too harshly: you are not competing
for any award at this stage. Just write and focus on the basic power
of consistency. Consistency brings forward the best version of
yourself in whatever you are committed to. Do it slow and steady. Be a
turtle, if that is what it takes to get to your destination. Check the
example below and good luck with everything!

* * *

I have been meaning to write for a long time now. But whenever I sit
down to express my thoughts, I blank. Even though I have all sorts of
ideas, there are no words to explain them. I do not know what to do
about it. So I am admitting to my failure. I came here to write
something grand and instead I am sharing how powerless I am in the
face of a mental block.

Perhaps I am like those lonely guests I used to serve five minutes
into my night shift, which would start at 16:00. I would open the bar
and make preparations for the super busy hours ahead. Work would start
in earnest at around 18:00 and would peak between 21:00 and midnight.
Those guys, universally men, would be there all alone. There was no
music playing. Not knowing what to do, they would order a pint of
lager and just hang at the bar. Sometimes they would chat with me for
a while, though not for long enough as I had all sorts of tasks to
tend to.

So here I am now. I arrived at the bar and it is too early for party
time. I could go back home, else quit, though that would probably be
even more boring than just riding it out here. Sure, itt will be
awkward for a little while. This is just in my head, anyway. Except I
am not at a bar, but in my own room, sitting in front of the computer,
trying to write my first journal entry while blanking on what to
cover.

Not knowing what to do, I shall describe whatever is around me and
take it from there. It is nighttime. I have the room's light switched
on. My monitor's brightness is set to a low level. I adjust it
depending on the environmental light. During the day I increase it and
will set it to the maximum if there is direct sunlight.

I am writing this in Emacs. My font size is set to a face `:height` of
`100`. This is the Emacs equivalent of `10pt` that other programs use.
When I do video calls I increase it to `180` to make it easier for
others to follow what I am demonstrating. Otherwise I prefer this
relatively low value.

My desktop computer is fairly loud. I have not done enough research
into the hardware parts. My suspicion is that the fans are too noisy.
I imagine there are silent options out there. Those might be more
expensive. I may check them out in the future, though this is not a
priority. All I am doing here is describing what is happening around
me.

Local time is close to 23:00. I have been active from the early
morning hours. Today was cloudy again. It will remain like this for
the whole week. There will hopefully be plenty of rainfall. The more
the better.

The dogs are asleep. We did our usual long walk in the mountains. They
ran around and expended all their energy. I am happy to be with them
every day, care for them, and set them up for success.

Even though it is late in the day, I still have the energy to keep
going. My teammates at the local football club used to call me "the
dog". If you have ever tried to dribble past a dog you know exactly
what that nickname is about. I would hound my opponents for the full
90 minutes as if my life depended on it. Playing with me in midfield
was fun because I would do all the dirty work while you would engage
in glamorous tricks.

Now I am more into nerdy endeavours with Emacs and free software,
while I still have the same levels of physical activity. I am not the
typical nerd. I did not grow up with computers. Tabletop games are
still alien to me. And, yes, mathematics is not my strong point. But I
am learning and am having fun.

I guess I also am not your typical intellectual either. I read stories
about famous thinkers, for example, only to realise that I am nothing
like them. They have these fabulous experiences that befit their
genius. At the age of 5 they were versed in the Socratic dialogues, at
12 they had compiled their first collection of poems, and at 15 they
were studying at some prestigious college. Me at 5 I was turning my
grandparents' furniture upside down. At 12 I was playing around in the
mud and at 15 I was picking fights with lads twice my age on football
fields made out of gravel.

Somehow I ended up here. Writing is a means of self-actualisation.
What you see here is an example of snippets of thought that pertain to
my immediate reality. I do not experience a mental block anymore.
Whenever I did, I would circumvent it by reporting on my day's
trivialities.
