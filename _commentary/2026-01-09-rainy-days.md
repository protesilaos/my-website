This is an entry from my journal. It is about keeping a sense of
perspective when things are not going our way.

* * *

Friday, the 9th of January. Noon will soon be upon us. It has been
raining heavily since last night. The weather forecast shows that the
present phenomena will persist until Tuesday. Late December until the
second third of January has been the peak rainy season in the
mountains of Cyprus for as long as I have been here. The past year was
extra dry. We endured a severe drought and even suffered major
wildfires that devastated large parts of the island. Precipitation is
a blessing, no matter how much it is. The more we get, the better our
chances of having a tolerable summertime.

The flood-control work I have done by the stream that is adjacent to
my land has been successful. The land is stable and the risk of damage
is virtually zero. Vegetation is growing at the spots that I set up.
Some of it is my doing. Plants will consolidate the soil, effectively
tying everything together. I have learnt to work with the natural
rhythms, to allow things to grow at their time, and to not feel
pressure to fast-forward anything into the future. As such, I do not
panic in the face of uncertainty and do not get upset when something
unexpected occurs during my day. I have stable plans, but am flexible
with my methods.

One such case is with the new battery I got two days ago for my
off-grid solar panel setup. I was expecting to receive it in
mid-November, which would have been a boon during the darkest days of
the year. The shipment got delayed a few times due to forces outside
my control or that of my business partners. Back then I maintained the
view that I am not disturbed by the inconvenience of not having
electricity during the cloudy/rainy days. Yes, it was unfortunate that
I could not work on the computer or even have the lights open, but it
was not actually harmful to me. I survived and remain as determined as
ever.

My perspective is that in the grand scheme of things a few weeks or
months of inconvenience do not matter, so long as progress is made
towards the goals I have set. Indeed, as I am typing this it is dark
outside. My computer is working fine and the battery is going strong.
I will be able to have video calls (for my coaching) in the evening
without worrying that I will get disconnected due to an abrupt power
cut (that was my old normal). What has transpired is irrelevant
insofar as my present is concerned. To dwell on the past, to complain
about things I could not affect and which are no longer in effect,
would not only be a waste of my energy but also a source of
frustration.

We suffer when there is a mismatch between our mental and physical
states. I know to work with what I have and to understand the
constitution of the case, such that what I want can follow
organically. I do not let thoughts which are not pertinent excite me
when my material reality does not justify the excitement. Similarly, I
do not entertain negative ideas when there is nothing actually bad
where I am. Instead of overthinking, I admit to not know. Instead of
trying to cling on to some fleeting reality, I accept that I do not
belong in that world. I am stable because, fundamentally, I do not put
regrets or aspirations ahead of facts.

I let go when I must. What happened and is to come is like the ocean.
There is no way for me to collect all of that water using the tiny
bucket which is my conscience and corresponding capacity to manipulate
my environment. I thus submit to the sovereignty of the greater
magnitudes which inform, frame, condition, or otherwise determine my
life. Some will say "nature", others "God" or "Poseidon", or a more
abstract "logos" or "dao". Names are symbols, steeped in myth and
narrative, which ultimately describe in different words and distinct
emphases that which is common in the multitude of events. To focus on
the narrative, to be fanatical about works of human institution, and
to kill in their name, is to miss the point entirely.

Letting go means that I carry no grudges. I live in my actuality. At
heart, I take good care of myself. I know how to love others---in the
sense of tending to their needs with the requisite respect but without
babying or belittling them---because I have practised extensively with
myself. Once you understand that it is essential to forgive yourself,
to not be a cruel judge, and to act fairly vis-à-vis your selfhood,
you will be able to extend that mode of benevolence outwardly.
Moreover, you shall be free to turn your attention to the brightest
dog in the sky. You will, in other words, not be preoccupied with
distractions.

Not letting go, which is the failure to shift your attention away from
the ephemera and their superficialities, ultimately means that you are
operating without a sense of perspective. You cannot tell where you
were and where you are heading towards. Like a disoriented wanderer in
an uncharted territory, you operate from a position of insecurity.
Yours is the understandable desire for control as a coping mechanism
in the face of fear. Consequently, you disregard the individuality of
others as you reduce everything to a function of your troubled ego and
of its want for predictability.

Rain continues to beat down. The fact that I have reliable electricity
is a nice extra, though by no means a precondition to appreciate the
gift from the heavens. When the conditions are suitable for outdoor
labour, I will be there to do what I must. And I will draw inspiration
from the peaks all around me, to stand tall no matter where the wind
blows.
