In this ~3-hour video I talk with Ro about a wide variety of topics
that cover programming, politics, lifestyle, and art. We start by
learning about Ro's work as a software engineer for military projects.
Ro studied electrical engineering and then transitioned to
programming.

I learn that Ro has an interest in politics and art. In terms of the
latter, Ro draws a portrait of me during our discussion. We talk until
the drawing is done, which you can check out towards the end of the
video.

On the politics front, we discuss my current thinking about political
issues, where I am interested in the implementation of any given
opinion. This is where I introduce the notion of "programmatic
thinking". The idea is to frame your opinions in terms of how you
could implement them, given the prevailing conditions. Doing so helps
filter out opinions that are not feasible.

We also comment on the quality of political discourse. Part of this is
informed by the current technology, which reduces the spacetime of
current affairs: everything happens instantly and feels proximate. Ro
suggests how people need to be getting together to discuss politics.
If people are open to talk, instead of shouting at each other, then
common sense can prevail.

Ro points out that discussions tend to avoid any kind of disagreement,
which Ro explains is not constructive: the realisation of
disagreements can still bring people closer, as they can appreciate
the others better and the diversity among us. Part of why this is
happening, I explain, is because people adopt an expanded conception
of identity, which includes their specific opinions. Then I go on to
comment how criticism can be constructive: it helps people grow by
better understanding what they are doing and why they do it.

The next topic is about the quality one has as a person. I comment on
how those who are influential have responsibility towards those they
influence. This is because they hold power. We explore this theme
further. I argue that if we decouple power from responsibility, then
we end up with egregious or abusive power.

The last big issue we cover is art. Specifically, how we can have a
better sense of our self through the pursuit of recreational
activities. Ro asks me about my writings. There are different sections
on my website, which cover distinct areas of interest I have. This
gives me the impetus to elaborate on the notion of being mindful of
our emotional state and how we can stay fresh. The point is to commit
to something that expresses a side of you. Ro comments how art is not
about the result, but rather that you enjoy doing it.

This is relevant also in light of Artificial Intelligence, which we
consider in further depth. I bring up the myth of Prometheus, which
reminds us how all technological innovations comes with pros and cons.
There are problems that come from the technology itself but also
others that are the result of how people use the technology.

We close with questions about me, such as my personality, way of
living, and the experience of blogging. This also connects to the
point about how people are attached to their opinions as an extension
of their identity. I explain how to think of our works as snapshots
of who we are. Mistakes are a part of it. If we acknowledge them, we
are more resilient, as we can change our views and/or face criticism
without fearing that we lose who we are. I say that we ultimately do
not need to take ourselves too seriously, in the sense that if we make
a mistake it will not be the end of the world.
