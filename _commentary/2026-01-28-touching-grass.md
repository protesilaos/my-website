This is an entry from my journal. I comment on how the Internet can
have a negative effect on one's outlook when not used in moderation.

The other day I was reading through my RSS feeds to catch up on the
news. I noticed an article with a title along the lines of "I want to
be allowed to hate on fatherhood" (me paraphrasing). The author was a
man about to tell us how much suffering is involved in being a father.
I thought to myself that this is yet another one of those common
performative gimmicks of the attention economy: the influencer must be
ever-more outrageous and controversial in order to outcompete other
influencers in the race for clicks.

Even though I knew that the content would not amuse me, I followed the
link. Yes, I am stupid. As I read through the first couple of
paragraphs, I realised that it was getting even more preposterous than
I had expected, with mothers who are hating on motherhood and the
like. So I stopped reading, unsubscribed from that feed, and went out
for a walk a bit earlier than planned.

Judging by what we get online, modern medicine is out of sync with the
times. Before delving into the specifics of one's health, the doctor
should ask "when was the little time you touched grass?" and should
then prescribe a couple of months of daily exposure to natural scenes
combined with a strict diet of no computer time past work. Sure, this
is tongue-in-cheek, though I do believe we are losing touch with the
basics. Once the meme becomes reality, new memes tend to be even more
egregious.

Walking connects me to my immediate reality. The pace of my hike is
relatively slow, as is the rate of change in my environment. Life here
is uneventful, in the sense that there is nothing "grand" happening on
the people front. Seasons come and go. With them I get the small joys
of each day, such as to notice slightly different colouration in the
river across my house, or to be exposed to the scent of a certain
flower. These are the kind of mildly uplifting feelings that will not
work for clickbait purposes, but will instil in you a sense of peace.

As I walk, a buffer is formed between my thoughts and my potential
actions. If, for example, I get the idea to write a flagrant
one-liner, I cannot do it impulsively. Instead, I have to slowly cover
the distance back home, while breathing fresh air and continuing to
think things through, and only then do the deed. By that time, the
urge to commit mayhem is gone. Same principle for long-form writing or
talking at length and in depth: it keeps you in check.

Think of how frequently people post something invidious and delete it
afterwards: it is because there is no intermediate space between their
incomplete thoughts and their capacity to broadcast byte-sized venom
in an instant.

In my surroundings, there is no controversy and strong feelings.
Things are calm. Here no form of life tries to be as hyperbolic as
possible. Nature is subtle even in its most awesome moments. I have
learnt from it to be simple in my ways. To appreciate the few things
that are available to me and to not complain for what is not mine.

The person who does not touch grass and is always online is
conditioned to constantly seek fuel for strong emotions, be they
pleasure, hatred, indignation, disgust, or pity. They need to be
compelled thus, for that is all their digital environment has ever
supplied them with. All emotional stimuli are readily available in
unlimited quantity.

As a side-effect of such conditioning, the person develops a sense of
entitlement, but also an expectation for constant intense stimulation:
they think the world owes them happiness, comfort, or whatnot.
Consequently, this is a milieu that is dominated by the increasingly
gory and obscene. It is all shouting at you, upping the pressure on
your conscience.

The digital world has a speed that is faster than what we can
sustainably live with. If you follow the news cycle for a while, you
already feel that the world is on the brink of collapse. Tune in to
any talk show to find people screaming at each other, no matter the
topic. After sufficient exposure, you are one degree away from either
exploding in frustration or imploding in depression. When subtlety is
lost, so is stability.

We underestimate the latent toxicity of information and of the
thoughts it can engender. We know that we should be careful about what
we eat, drink, and breath, but we forget that what we think also
contributes to our wellness or lack thereof. The information we are
exposed to creates a certain climate that skews our perception
accordingly. The question, then, is whether this is a viable
environment for us.

Touching grass is not necessarily comfortable. It requires some effort
and does not provide instant gratification on demand. We have to earn
it through patience and perseverance. Nature is not the omniscient,
benevolent figure that tends to our well-being and conspires in our
favour. That is the figment of our wishful thinking. What we get in
the great outdoors is indifferent to us. Nature does not make promises
and no-one is entitled to anything. The more you are out there instead
of being in your head, the more you realise that you are not at the
centre of the world.

I am here as a passenger. Later I could miss a step, fall, break my
neck, and die on the spot. That almost happened to me a few winters
ago when I stepped on ice and went sliding downhill at 5 in the
morning, with nobody around. This world does not revolve around me: it
will carry on the way it always does. It does not idolise me. I am not
its epicentre. I am yet another life form the same way rats and trees
are.

This is not me devaluing myself, rationalising my lack of self-esteem,
or whatnot. Even the most conventionally successful or popular person
is subject to the same forces. Whatever importance we think we have,
nature reminds us that it is not much. So I am a philosopher, among
others. One may think this is a major achievement. In the sense of
putting in the work, indeed it is not something that comes about
easily. Though being a philosopher is no different than being a
non-philosopher, if we abstract away the details: we all are people
who will get the same treatment by the cosmos, namely, ageing and
death, typically combined with a hard lesson in humility.

The "has been" kind of celebrity wants to cling on to their past
glory, such as by claiming that "in my time I was swaying public
opinion and moving the crowds". Well, now you are reaching your end
and nobody cares who you used to be.

Such is the bigger picture. I am humble because I understand that (i)
I have no ownership over anything that is nominally "me", such as my
intelligence or looks, and (ii) however good I am, there are
magnitudes that are far more potent than me. No matter how strong my
volition is, it is not able to halt that which is inexorable, nor to
alter that which is immutable.

Coming back to that article, I could comment on the substantive point,
but it would be a futile effort. The reason is that the incentives for
extremism are systemic. Once this fad of the parent who hates
parenthood runs its course, it will be superseded by a yet more
extremist position, such as the parent who cultivates and then sells
their offspring for profit, and so on. I cannot even come up with
realistic scenaria anymore, as the real outcomes will probably be far
worse than what I can imagine, if the memes are allowed to run amok.

The reason I unsubscribed from that feed is because I do not want my
mental state to be governed by phenomena that are not pertinent to my
being and to be distorted by methods that prey on my feelings. Why did
I subscribe to begin with? Because I thought there was some decent
journalism there, which has been on a steady decline for several
months due to the innate logic of the attention economy: exaggerations
are better for viewership.

Clickbait is the intended transmission mechanism. The whole routine of
"comment, like, subscribe, and hit the bell button" is the ritual
sacrifice we make to the altars of profitability. Deep down we know we
are being disrespected by such manipulation tactics, yet the system is
set up to reward those who exploit them the most.

The Internet distorts spacetime by making everything appear proximate
and imminent. It is not. As soon as I switch off the computer, I am
presented with a world whose rhythms match mine. I quit social media a
long time ago for the same reason. Idem for not turning my phone into
a "productivity" tool: I do not want to be constantly connected to an
information network that is withdrawn from my actuality.

The sun is about to rise. I am ready for another day. I know that I am
not special in this place. I will not be rewarded with everything my
heart desires. And I do not matter in the end. Such is tranquillity.
