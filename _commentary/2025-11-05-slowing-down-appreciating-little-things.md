This is an entry from my journal.

* * *

I seldom travel. If I go further than a few kilometres, it will be to
the next closest city for some essential task, such as to buy a new
pair of glasses or take the dogs to the vet. Otherwise, I just stay in
my area and tend to my tasks. The journeys I do are on foot. Even
though I cover a lot of ground, I still experience the same place,
more or less. Life here is largely uneventful. There is some work
being done in the surrounding vineyards three times a year and that is
all to it. The area is otherwise devoid of human activity.

I do not feel bored. I keep drawing inspiration from the phenomena I
witness. Everything in nature is on the move. Each unit in this
continuum of life, from the smallest to the largest, does some kind of
work. The celestial bodies, which may well be constituents of a
greater organism and conscience, contribute to an interplay of factors
whose full extent we cannot fathom yet whose manifestations we study
in awe. Wherever we turn, there are systems of systems, which
themselves exhibit pattern and structure, with feedback loops that
constitute language, inherent dynamics that establish rules, and
procedures which amount to computation. The processes are
comprehensible, the products discoverable, the ends obscure.

Instead of demanding that the world grants me what I want, I learn to
observe it and, where possible, to participate in its workings. This
inspires me to compose the following poem, which I will also post in
[the "Poems" section](https://protesilaos.com/poems) of my website:

```
The November skies

Set ideologies aside
The flocking crows
shall guide you
to look skyward
where the travelling Sun
paints its November skies
```

The full moon is high in the sky right now. It glows in a near-white
light. The higher it is, the more intense the white colour. Whereas at
moonrise and moonset, the glow is of a more yellowish hue. The valley
alights on such nights and you can see far away. Moonbathed hikes are
among my favourites. There is a special aura to them, like something
extraordinary is happening. And it actually is. To think that there is
a satellite around our planet, which itself orbits a star, which in
turn moves around a specific section of the galaxy, and so on. How
many of these relationships have to be in line for me to be here doing
this!? I do not take it for granted.

Nighttime is generally more quiet than daytime. Most birds are resting
and this time of the year I do not hear any frogs or crickets. The
foxes can only be heard during their mating season. Otherwise they
operate in stealth. I went for a walk with my four dogs. The puppies
are growing each day. Oreeon must be closer to 25 kilograms now.
Meelon is smaller. Maybe 20? They are getting along well with my two
older dogs, Atlas and Raizou. All four of them are playing tug-of-war
and games of chase. It warms my heart to see them happy.

The younger ones can now cover longer distances. Though I am easing
them in. Their body is still developing. For now, we are getting used
to moving a little further each time, in the mornings and at night.
This helps the puppies gain confidence in their abilities. They do not
feel overwhelmed by all the new stimuli and can explore the world at
their own pace.

Forcing things to happen is when the problems begin. I cannot make my
puppies behave like adult dogs. If I push too hard in that direction,
I will get adverse results. Their joints will suffer from injuries,
due to the increased workload. They will lack the skills they gain
through daily playfighting to actually stand their ground when
necessary. Their sense of initiative will not be cultivated because
they will be conditioned to conform with my forceful whims.

Mine is the laissez faire approach to life. I allow things to come
about organically. When I act towards a certain goal, I do it in a
manner that respects the natural boundaries. For example, I will give
new shape to the land, but still allow vegetation to grow, plus
whatever I will plant. This way the soil will never be prone to
erosion and I will not have to constantly support whatever structures
I set in place. My schemes thus factor in the other forms of life,
trying to work with them towards a new equilibrium. Not even the Sun,
this luminous body of immense power output, can exceed the boundaries
imposed upon it by its nature.

In this slow-paced life, I have the luxury of not getting disturbed by
too many events happening in quick succession. When we move faster
than our natural pace, we eventually lose our balance, literally and
in terms of our perception. This we can understand from the times we
have gone on a ride, such as with a speeding motorcycle or a fast car.
Our brain gets conditioned to the new normal of everything in sight
disappearing from the periphery of our vision within milliseconds. If
we get off the vehicle abruptly and try to walk slowly, we find that
we cannot control our body the way we normally do. The reason is that
the faster pace is setting in place the capacities for tolerating more
of the same. Eventually, it also creates the expectation for faster
and ever-thrilling experiences. The same happens with fast-paced video
games, such as first-person shooters. Once you are immersed in the
game, you cannot simply get out and walk slowly. There has to be a
period of adjustment in between.

When speed is a choice that can be sustained, then it is consistent
with your actuality. Though it often happens that the rhythms of
quotidian life are imposed upon us by circumstance and inertia. We do
not think about them and allow them to happen, until we eventually
find ourselves in a situation where something elusive is upsetting and
depleting us. It is the fact that we are pushing against the
boundaries, trying to be faster than what our nature has regulated as
the viable upper bound. Mental fatigue and physical pain are the signs
that we are doing something wrong. Usually we complain about it, but
do not act decisively to change our ways. We instead dismiss them as
"this is life" and try to find some coping mechanism like the hottest
trends with meditation and stoicism. No, this is not some
inevitability forced upon you. It is an instituted arrangement of
interpersonal relations, underpinned by social expectations, that
demands from you a pound of flesh each time in the service of some
goal that you can actually live without.

Another aspect of this disempowering passivity towards the fast-paced
experience is with the Internet. We get involved in so many online
groups or activities to the point of spending most of our day in front
of a screen in anticipation of the next notification. Ding! The
excitement rises... The stream of information that hits us each day is
akin to the highway where seemingly immobile objects around us escape
our conscience while we continue forward apace. Nothing has staying
power at that point. It is a surface with no depth: a facade of a
thing, a simulacrum of an experience. There is the one, now it is the
other, succeeded by the next, and so on in what effectively becomes a
two-dimensional experience of life. In the blink of an eye, years pass
and we wonder what did we even do in the meantime.

When I first started paying attention to the near-static things in my
milieu, I noticed not only their beauty but also the benign effect of
slowing down. I became more patient and would not be annoyed by
something not becoming available right away. I would work with what
was readily available and be content with it, instead of feeling
dejected for not having that which was meant to be delivered in a
just-in-time fashion to my doorstep.

This is happening right now, for example. I have spent the last two
years working towards upgrading my off-grid solar power setup with a
new battery. In the meantime, I have had to make compromises of not
using the desktop computer past the late afternoon and of not having
electricity at night and early in the morning. Instead of complaining
and suffering the torment of blaming my tough luck, I accepted that
things are happening organically and I may discover enriching
activities of an alternative sort. My adaptation has thus been
graceful: I did not insist on having one specific set of factors and
allowed my mind to be open to new possibilities. This has allowed me
to be stronger and more resilient.

I have learnt to compartmentalise my activities. In the past, I would
listen to music in the background while writing or programming. I
eventually understood that this was a bad habit from the time I was
conditioned to a faster pace. My being was yearning for that stimulus
because it was effectively addicted to it. It would not tolerate the
relative calm. My greater mental fortitude, which is the product of
slowing down and living within my means, allows me to be in control of
my feelings. I now listen to music with intent. I give it my undivided
attention. It happens when I want to and involves my participation.

The same for the devices I use. Long ago, I would type on the laptop
for hours on end. When I would feel tired sitting at the desk, I would
take the laptop with me to the couch. Eventually I realised this was
not conducive to a separation of concerns. I was not allowing myself
to have clear delineations between work and rest and was ultimately
less productive and less energetic. The laptop stays on the desk. If I
ever need to go do some computer work elsewhere, I will take it with
me. But it will always be a regulated usage.

And the same for my exposure to the Internet. I do not passively
consume "content". If I watch a video, it is because I am interested
in learning something or listening to a conversation. If I read an
article, it is for similar reasons. Otherwise, I am not keen on
"catching up" with whatever the news is, nor am I curious about the
current vaunted thing that everybody is hyping up. I do not care about
the latest controversy and so-called "drama"---such a nice Greek word
that we are now associating with tempests in teapots. I am not in the
business of accumulating Internet points and the ephemeral validation
they promise. When I am done with my work, I shut down the computer
and go outside.

Many of our world's dominant beliefs involve some form of escapism.
They tell us how this life is somehow problematic or undesirable and
that there is another realm where our existence is of a noble kind,
provided we meet certain conditions. My world-view is different. It
unfolds without expectations about future lives and potential worlds.
I do not feel compelled to believe in anything other than what I
experience. I do not sense the need to be anywhere else. I remain
present in my presence, a hero in my struggles who faces the
challenges with grit and tenacity. If there is another reality, I will
be present in it because such is the necessity of being.

Slowing down has empowered me to accept this life first and to delve
in its bottomless depths, before seeking another. I am not distracted
away from what is pertinent to my environment. There is no disturbance
within me, no pressure to force things into becoming. I am like the
stones and the canes around me. They are endowed with musicality. In
them there is structure and pattern, as they echo the cosmic rhythms
and sing in concert the song of the stars. They are partaking in---and
influenced by---processes beyond them that interface with their
internal mechanics. I am no different. Not anymore special that each
presence here. I do not pray to any universe to conspire in my favour.

The moon moves to its next phase. November is upon us and December
will follow. There is less green all around. The same place is never
exactly the same. It is ever-changing and I have developed the
capacity of appreciating it. To what end? Why would I even worry about
the end when I am still here, my friend?
