What follows is an entry from my journal.

* * *

I walked up the mountain to catch the moon rise.  Just last month, I
witnessed two full moons at my mountain, though the phenomenon remains
as awe-inspiring as ever.  I find these moments fulfilling and
empowering.  When I witness those horizons, I feel more comfortable
with openendedness.  I do not limit my thinking to the realm of the
familiar.  Nor do I trouble myself with issues that I know are
irrelevant in the grand scheme of my life.  More importantly though, I
do not become invested in a particular outcome.  Things will run their
course, anyway.

The vastness of this world inspires me to not assume dead ends where
there are none and to not imagine them to be there when I am in doubt.
To every fatalistic thought about the state of our affairs, I respond
with an eagerness to lead by example, to remain restless the way
nature all around me is, and to take even the one chance out of the
hundred.  Why give up when I can do more and when every other form of
life I know of struggles to maintain its form?  I shall try my best,
while I can.

As I scale the mountain, I realise this is a difficult climb.  I do it
every day and find it normal to proceed without pausing, though I know
it is an impossible challenge for the uninitiated.  The mountain trail
is a metaphor for solitude.  There are times when no-one will join you
on your path.  Do you feel sad and seek to find company instead?  Or
do you venture forth regardless, accepting how things stand?  And if
you do choose to be with others, do you not regret not fulfilling your
potential?  Are you not lacking something, as if a part of you is
curtailed?

Solitude is not the same as loneliness.  The way I understand the
latter, it happens in the midst of others.  You decide to be with
them, perhaps out of need or fear, only to realise that nobody seems
to comprehend you.  Sure, you can communicate about certain issues,
but you know it is not enough for you.  You want more, you need
something else.  Loneliness is when you realise in despair the
mismatch between your needs and the inadequacy of the stimuli in your
milieu.  You feel lost, as there seems to be no place for you anymore.
"If even they do not understand me, who will?"  This is the sort of
feeling you get.  By contrast, solitude is the mere fact of being
alone.  It does not mean you are unsettled by the absence of others in
your daily life.

How can there be people atop the mountain, friend?  If you expect to
find everybody there, you are a fool for misjudging the case.
Traversing the path requires that you accept the trade-off involved.
Whether there will ever be fellow travellers is not for you to decide
or foreshadow.  There is no room for contempt, no sense of elitism.
These, I think, are misguided, as they are about other people and how
you mistakenly insist in appraising yourself relative to them, as if
there is no other possibility.  Suspend judgement.  Enjoy the
moonshine's beauty and note that the path is simple, provided you
accept who you are.

You cannot live the life of another.  Everyone operates within
confines they had no say over and cannot undo either unilaterally or
at all.  If I were a swallow, I would have to cross the sea to find
more temperate climates.  My small wings would make it hard for me to
cover long distances.  Each time I would accidentally touch the water
out of fatigue, I would know that I was an inch away from my demise.
Yet I would continue flying in recognition of what my condition had
made unavoidable.

Since I am who I am, I will keep exploring the landscapes in my area,
I will feel joy once I hear the frogs again, and when the next moon
rises I will try my best to reach the highest peak one more time.  Not
to prove anything, not to apologise to anyone for not being like them,
but only to remain honest about the little things that work for me; to
admit that I like this regardless of others, for it springs from
within and finds its telos therein.

Open vistas help us change our attitude.  We literally gain a
different perspective and are then inspired to meditate about our
woes.  For example, I spent several weeks without electricity at home.
Most people tend to complain when they are in an uncomfortable
situation.  I have learnt to look at the bigger picture.  It is why I
remain calm in the face of uncertainty.  If the cosmos is arranged
thus for me to be in this place at this time, I might as well see what
is in store for me.  I take it as an opportunity to grow as a person,
to model my mindset after the surrounding mountainscapes.  To complain
in such a case is to not want to see what may be in the horizon.

As I type these words next to the candle fire, I hold the image of the
night sky in my head.  It keeps me grounded.  I am thankful to have
witnessed this and shall always be content with what I have, for as
long as I have it.  Let others measure worthiness the way they do.
And let me continue on my path.
