The following is an excerpt from a private exchange. The
quoted/indented parts belong to my correspondent. I comment on how we
can frame our thinking so as not to feel lost in the modern era.
Keeping a sense of perspective is important at all times.

I agree with you about the impact of AI on creators. Though I
encourage you to consider the wider context. Doing so will allow you
to better appreciate the technological, social, and historical trends
and thus to not feel depressed or worried about a particular instance
of them. I also want you to keep in mind the separation between "fine
art" and "art at-large", as it helps frame the discussion about
quality and authenticity.

My view is that AI is the latest instantiation of age-old tendencies
pertaining to the mass production of art. This is about art at-large.
For example, we keep unearthing ancient Greek pottery because,
fundamentally, the people of that time had streamlined the production
of those items. Each piece would have some practical utility, though
all the drawing on its walls were a form of relatively easy-to-produce
painting; painting for the masses that also made business sense.

Art at-large is in everything we buy. Consider how IKEA not only sells
furniture but goods that have a certain aesthetic. There is a way to
their style which is recognisable. Consumer electronics are no
different. Apple has made an empire out of its emphasis on design and
concomitant marketing. Think of anything that has an interface, from
door handles to car dashboards, and you will discern the touch of art.
Take any piece of clothing or footwear and ask yourself why is not
just blank? Why do we need to add some colours and patterns to it? Why
must they be different from each other? And you can apply this
thinking to everything around you. The gist is that art at-large has
been and will always be subject to streamlining yet retain its nature
qua art.

What AI is doing right now can be considered another instance of mass
production. Yes, the models may not be deterministic, but they still
have this quality of outputting large quantities of art. For our
purposes, they meet the demand that has been in effect since antiquity.

Fine art is different though. It is always about exclusivity. If I
have the paintings of Rembrandt, for example, then you cannot also
have them. For most of its history, fine art was appreciated as
mastery of the highest order. When El Greco paints his famous _View of
Toledo_, we do not simply get a landscape, but a piece whose inherent
work with the materials is of the finest calibre. The painting also
has a meta value, which is the statement it makes in terms of the
aesthetics it applies and the subject it has: to work on something
other than an anthropocentric theme and thus to run counter to the
sensitivities of that specific milieu of theocratic Spain.

With the advent of modern art, the attention shifts to the meta value.
The craft becomes secondary. The modern artist is no longer
untouchable skill-wise the way its predecessors are. Rather, the
modern artist relies on the narrative to drive up the value of the
works. For example, Marcel Duchamp took a generic bidet, put his
signature on it and---voilà---modern art was born. The bidet is like
every other that came out of the assembly line, but that particular
one has a story behind it. As such, this is mastery of story-telling
above all.

To my mind, modern art has been debasing fine art long before we even
had widespread AI. It turned the practice into sophistry, kind of how
everything that becomes "too meta" ultimately loses touch with the
reality it was preoccupied with. Because the art piece acquires its
worth through the narrative that is woven around it, it is up to the
spin doctors who run the galleries and auction houses to build up the
excitement, and then for investors with a penchant for kitsch to pour
in zillions into this burgeoning market of pretentiousness. I say this
is a convenient way to inflate asset prices, which can then be used to
launder money, avoid taxation through so-called "philanthropy",
"patronage of the arts" and the like. The creator who cares about
their craft is pushed to the side and dismissed for the sin of not
being sufficiently smug.

I see fine art as something that engenders in us a sense of awe. Take
Jean-François Millet's _The Gleaners_, for example: not only are they
untouchable skill-wise, they also invite us to appreciate the little
things of everyday life, to find in them the universals, and to aspire
to our highest. Now if a bidet is the best art can give us because
some poser declared thus, then whatever AI stitches together is also
art. The latter may even have more work put into it... My point is
that AI adds noise to what was already happening.

To this end, I feel we have to demand more from artists. Be assertive
in calling out nonsense and show its dealers the middle finger.

The kind of person who would take this over an expertly crafted work
was anyway not going to appreciate the finer points or was not willing
to pay for it.

Though, again, we have to factor in history so as to not be upset by
today's prevailing conditions. Patronage of the fine arts happened in
certain eras at some places. It did not exist everywhere. To make good
money as a painter is the exception to the rule.

Which brings me to the point of the reason a person produces art. It
ultimately comes from within: there is an inner need for expression
and self-actualisation. An artist may be able to make a living selling
their works, though that is secondary to the innate inclination for
art. And, yes, art may bring social validation and even fame, though
those mean nothing if the aforementioned need is not satisfied.

Also note how patronage of the sort you described tends to constrain
the creativity of the creator. If I only find meaning in drawing
landscapes while the patron wants a portrait which I dislike, then I
will have to do something contrary to my aesthetic sensitivities. If
the artist has no need for the money, they will likely demand full
artistic control instead of conforming with the guidelines of the
buyer. Patronage thus becomes obsolete.

I will continue with my commentary below, but here I want to make a
brief remark. Remember that you do something because it matters to
you. We may put it differently: the Muse compels you into action. The
fact that others do not heed the voice of the Muse is irrelevant to
what you understand as your calling, namely, to make art and to
express yourself accordingly.

The history of artists is the history of "weird". At least modern art
gets this part right, even though it makes a mockery out of it. The
artist is not a "normal person" because their capacity to produce fine
art is a rare trait. Even the ability to make art at-large is not
common. This is why we still appreciate elegance, even in matters that
are not art per se: elegance is not the norm.

Artists are also not "normal" because they do not agree with the
majority view about what constitutes productivity versus wastefulness.
To the average person, drawing water lilies with a passion á la Claude
Monet is a strange way to spend your time when, say, you could be
doing commerce instead, or sport, or chasing skirts.

Once you accept this reality, you will be empowered to make the best
work of your life. Else you will forever remain subject to the
downward pressures of public opinion. Be bold and unapologetic about
your art. Everything else is a distraction.

It is appropriate to call such people "naive". Why would you allow
another person to make your life miserable by simply holding an
uninformed opinion? More generally, why subject yourself to the
vicissitudes of opinion, at all? Focus on the inherent quality of your
interests and make the most out of them. Yes, this means that your
journey in certain parts is going to be lonely. Such is the fate
allotted to you. The best you can hope for, friend, is to find fellow
travellers on your path. Be mentally strong in the meantime by
focusing on your deeds.

The gaming industry is massive and already has the quality of
patronage that we covered earlier. Namely, business drives artwork and
programming. Yet this does not prevent you from creating your own
games and having fun in the process. Even if AI makes the best games
possible at the push of a button, you will still derive joy from your
craft. This is true for other fields of endeavour, such as how some of
us enjoy making our own bread instead of buying industrial loaf. Or,
you know, actually preferring a conversation instead of texting each
other.

In conclusion: we have been here before and authenticity will always
matter to some. Do your thing and the rest will follow.
