The following is an excerpt from a private exchange. I am publishing
it with the permission of my correspondent. Their identity remains
private. The indented/quoted text is what I am replying to.

I think it has to do with how I approach my creativity in general. I
have learnt to tend to my needs, by allowing that which is within me
to take form. Instead of forcing it to happen, I let it come about
organically. This is why the following are true:

1. I sometimes go for weeks without publishing a new video. If I am
   not feeling it, then it is not the right moment for it. It will not
   be authentic.

2. The topics I cover are not limited to a specific target audience.
   One day I will write about Emacs, for example, and the other I will
   produce an article about life in the mountains and then another
   about some political ideas. I mean, even if there is an audience
   for such intersections, it must be tiny.

3. I follow my "alla prima" method of creativity and trust in myself
   to perform well enough: I am expressing what is ready to be
   elucidated and am interested in capturing my authentic self in the
   moment. Sure, there is value in works that are refined over time
   (e.g. the free software I develop), but those are not a snapshot of
   myself. When I write a journal entry or do a video, I want to both
   elaborate on the substantive point and test how I am doing it in
   the moment.

If I was into the performative game, I would be operating in terms of
maximising my impact in pursuit of profits. This would include, among
others, (i) editing my videos, (ii) using catchy thumbnails, (iii)
relying on clickbait, (iv) generally manipulating people into paying
attention to me, and (v) promoting my content on Reddit and social
media. To be clear, I am not against people who do that---these are
the ways the game is played. I simply do not care about playing that
game myself. I find it relaxing to be myself and stressful to pretend
to be another.

Finally, the performance game is also about appearing as an authority
in the given field. Whereas I make it clear that I am nothing of the
sort. For example, in my "about me" page on my website I clearly note
that I only have a Bachelor's degree. Or, for my coding endeavours, I
tell people that I am not a professional programmer and have not
studied computer science or related disciplines. In short, I am just a
guy in the mountains who speaks his mind: take it for what it is and
then think for yourself. If you spot my mistakes, that is great: you
will help me become aware of them and you are already thinking
independently.

The social anxiety you mention can be a liability though consider how
it puts you in a tough spot where you have an incentive to act.
Instead of asking a question, you may choose to do more research about
it and come up with your own solution. Sure, this is the hard way and
it can be frustrating as results do not come about quickly. Though it
can be rewarding long-term as you gain a deeper insight into the
subject and are empowered to make connections that would otherwise not
be possible.

What I have learnt about what we may consider "character flaws", or
which anyway are seen as weaknesses by the general public, is that
they can actually be strong points or lead to the formation of benign
qualities. Put differently, not all hope is lost. It is a matter of
trying in earnest and of not having a defeatist attitude. Tell
yourself that you are not good enough only after you have tried to the
best of your abilities. Then your self-assessment is fair and then you
will already be more lenient with yourself because you know you did
not cheat.

The part about being "competent enough" is a trap. It only matters if
you choose to brand yourself as the foremost expert in the field.
Otherwise, you are contributing what is congruent with your level
(assuming you are not trying to deceive people). In the case of the
Emacs community, for example, you may have a blog where you describe
what you are learning by using Emacs, the parts you like and those you
do not like. This is no longer about whether you are "competent
enough" but how genuine your human side is. Of course, you can still
be highly informative in whatever it is you are working on.

All fora are tricky because of a number of factors that are unrelated
to the quality of your contribution. For example, you may write
something constructive but your timing is wrong because some company
released their new product and now everyone is riding the hype train.

Here is what I remember of a joke that a friend once shared about
Facebook. I think it captures the essence of many online experiences:

You spend a couple of hours thinking of something deep to expound on.
Then you take care to write it as best you can. You publish it,
expecting an exchange of profound thoughts. A few hours later, you
check back in anticipation of the flood of notifications you have
received. But there is nothing of substance. You have received one
"like" from your mother and a "fuck off, mate, let's go for drinks"
response from your best friend. Disappointed as you are, you start
scrolling aimlessly at your feed. As you go past the posts and ads,
you notice an entry from the hottie of your neighbourhood that was
sent 5 minutes ago. "I am drinking coffee on my balcony ðŸ™ƒ" is the
message. To your astonishment, you notice right below 5000 likes, 3000
comments, and 2 Champions League trophies!

The point is to know what you are likely to get on these platforms.
Focus on your work. You will eventually discover like-minded people
who will be keen on sharing their passion with you. Even if you get
exposure on social media or some forum, keep in mind that it is
short-lived. What will keep people around for longer is the quality of
your work. "Quality" may be about how informative or intriguing the
content is or how authentic you are. It depends on the subject.

I have been publishing since February of 2011. The topics and focus
have changed over the years, reflecting my evolution. Even my writing
style is different. What has remained constant is my outlook. I see
this as a solitary endeavour. If there is at least one person out
there who finds my publications and learns something from them, it is
a bonus. I am happy, but I still did what I did out of an inner need:
to speak my mind in earnest.

Early on, I realised that my friends/classmates were not necessarily
interested in the same things I was and did not have the enthusiasm
for writing/reading that I had/have. It is why I started to only write
as a means of expressing myself. When I decided to do videos, I did it
because I wanted to keep practising my English skills. Maybe I should
do it with French at some point, but it is hard to have a multilingual
website.

I was doing "alla prima" early on, though I was not consistent with
it. Some publications took me more than one sitting. The last several
years, maybe since pre-Covid, have been especially easy in this
regard. I write the article in one go or record the video and just
send it.

Perhaps there is merit to the idea of building an audience at the
outset. It all comes down to what your priorities are and what you are
trying to achieve. If, for instance, you are bent on monetising your
platform, then you must play the game we covered earlier. Otherwise
you simply do your thing and allow things to happen organically.

Will the organic approach guarantee results? No, but why would that be
relevant given the intent behind it? If you are publishing as a means
of self-exploration, then you already get what you ask for. Everything
else is extra.

Not targeting an audience guarantees that you remain true to yourself
throughout the stages of your intellectual development. Otherwise, you
have a strong incentive to role play and to ultimately sell what you
think people are demanding.

It is good to know what works for you and what does not. This way you
focus on the things that appeal to you and become good at them. Doing
it your own way also means that you will be somewhat unorthodox in at
least some of your methods, which sometimes is what gives that special
quality to your work. Formal qualifications are important, though they
can be overrated.

You are right: there is no conflict here. The motivation to help
others is strong and will give you the impetus you need to press on
with your interests. Besides, teaching others involves learning as
well. Even somebody who knows nothing about a given topic will
inevitably provide you with at least a new data point about how a
beginner deals with the situation.

The key is to not expect that others will quickly line up to hear what
you have to say. That can happen over time. In the meantime, you will
need to show consistency and the commitment it entails.

It is disheartening to be dismissed for who you are rather than what
you are saying, I know. And it will be lonely more often than not
because there are not many out there who (i) stand at the same
intersection you are on of current knowledge/ability and research
orientation, while (ii) also knowing about you. The idea that "great
minds think alike" may be true though it should come with the proviso
"but they do not know about each other's presence and are unlikely to
meet early on."

That granted, even such disheartening treatment has didactic value: it
is not too bad. You learn how people behave out there sometimes, i.e.
like a pack of wolves, and you understand that you will have to earn
your place through sustained effort. The days of being cuddled and
welcomed are long gone.

To use an analogy from my days playing football, when I was promoted
to train with the men's team, I was not treated as the boy I still
was. No! I was given the adult treatment: strong challenges, hard
tackles, and harsh language. I thus had to fight for my place and earn
my keep. You think you are tough because you are a bit older and
bigger? Let me show you what tenacity is!

This is not about being vindictive, but about building up tolerance
for adversity. There are people out there who will be your friends or
who, anyway, are well-meaning. Others will be nasty and combative. And
everything in between. What you will realise though, which is the
essence of sport, is that your fiercest competitor is actually your
greatest colleague: by pushing you to your limits, they empower you to
be the best version of yourself. In the absence of a challenge, we get
complacent, sloppy, and ultimately ineffective.

Maybe those people are wrong in the way they rejected you: they can
benefit from refining their communications skills. But ignore the
means and focus on the salient point. They are still telling you in
their unpleasant way how you have to build up your credibility, which
you will do one step at a time by committing to the task long-term.

As for changing the world, you are already on the right path. You
changed something about yourself. You took the time to do something
you care about. Keep it up and observe how the world continues to
evolve partly in response to your deeds.

Well put! The work you do is worthwhile also because it has a
compounding effect: the more you do it, the better you get at it. So
even if a single case is not enough, the cumulative effect can be
rewarding.
