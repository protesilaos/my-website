This is an entry from my journal in which I comment at length on how
the desire for control can be useful and harmful.

Another rainy day. The clouds have been low in the valley. I can
barely see the opposite side, even though it is about a hundred metres
away. Every time of the year has its beauty. This is no different. I
appreciate it while it lasts.

The nearby stream gets flooded whenever there is heavy rainfall: it is
why I spent months setting up flood-control infrastructure and
redirecting the flow of water. On such days gravel comes downstream. I
have put some sturdy obstacles to hold the larger pieces in place,
while still allowing water to flow through. Stones and sand accumulate
there. I collect them daily with a shovel and distribute them around
my land on a wheelbarrow.

There are several spots in my land that get muddy and slippery. By
putting coarse earth over them, I make them safer to traverse. Plus
the result looks pretty. This project is time-consuming. Working in
the ice cold water is uncomfortable, though it is worth the trouble.
Once I am done, I will remove the obstacles from the stream so that
they do not hold back anything I would not want to have there
long-term.

I check all the spots in my vicinity to make sure everything is as it
ought to be. I am proactive, though knowing what is happening allows
me to act in a timely fashion if I need to intervene. Being in control
is a matter of safety as well as a precondition for iterating on my
goals without experiencing major setbacks. For example, I never
actually had to deal with a flood since I first came here. But if I
had never done any of that work, the kind of weather we have now after
an intense drought would have surely put me at greater risk of harm.
This is due to how dry soil with insufficient vegetation is more prone
to erosion: there is nothing to hold it together.

Generally, I maintain situational awareness. It allows me to act
swiftly, calmly, and decisively. This is what I did when the wildfires
were raging this past summer. I kept my cool in large part because I
had a clear mental map of where to be and the possible paths to
safety: I had been checking them out on a daily basis.

Alertness stands beside paranoia. One must be safe, but being "too
safe" detracts from the quality of life. What helps is to have a sense
of the longer term: the world is not collapsing. If we focus too much
on the short-term and the details, we lose sight of the bigger
picture, which engenders in us the functional equivalent of
claustrophobia. In other words: it disempowers us.

The narrow perspective may distort our perception, in how we estimate
the extent of a threat or the interplay of factors. Indeed, too narrow
a view will make us miss relevant factors altogether, both those that
contribute to potential trouble and the ones that provide an antipode
to it.

Our outlook aside, we have to tend to our physical condition. One must
be able to breath easily, if they are to think clearly. More so in
times of duress. The baseline heart rate has to be fairly low, so that
there is enough of a buffer when push comes to shove.

In short, the mental and the physical go together. Those who think
that meditation alone, without respect for the body, will give them
peace of mind, are in for a rude awakening.

One earns the power of control through consistency and patience. It is
a state of being characterised by balance and elegance. Those who are
typically described as "control freaks" are not actually in control of
anything, which is why they are freaking out all the time. All they
are good at is to anger and/or infantilise those around them. Maybe
their desire is to reach a point where they can affect their
environment. But want alone amounts to nothing if it is not
underpinning a stepwise plan of action to build up the requisite
capacity.

The hut project has given me a house. This is its purpose. I like it
for that very reason. Though it has also affected certain intangibles.
It is my own initiative and its product is a function of my labour. As
such, it reinforces the impression that part of my fate is in my own
hands. I know that if something does not work well, it is because I
did not do it properly or completely failed to account for some
factor. And, conversely, if everything is in order or moving in the
right direction it is due to my ongoing efforts.

Being told what to do without a cogent argument as to why has always
rubbed me the wrong way for as long as I can remember. Give me a valid
point and I will follow. Demonstrate with reason or facts and I obey.
Else do not bother. Physically, I need an outlet for my energy. Let me
run, let me dig, let me explore. Just let me be: I do not interfere
with anyone's activities and will not boss anybody around. Same on the
intellectual front, where I want to express my thoughts without
holding anything back. I do not appeal to any authority nor do I claim
to be an expert. I just have to be left to my own devices.

Where I am, I love that nobody will do the work in my stead. Mine is a
double-edged life: reward for my achievements and punishment for my
shortcomings. Having embraced this reality, I do not brag about the
good things nor do I complain about the bad ones. "Good" and "bad" are
mere figures of speech. To me here, what is, simply is. There is no
attendant judgement call that matters. I accept the consequences of my
choices without arguing with the heavens and am prepared to deal with
the circumstances as they unfold.

People operate on a spectrum of safety and risk, which correlates with
blending in versus standing out. At the one extreme are those who
follow the beaten path, act on the basis of directives, respect
existing structures, and take no responsibility for their actions. At
the other extreme is someone like me, who will speak their mind and be
ready to take the hit on the chin.

When I launched my website, for example, I was still a university
student yet was already vociferous as if I was a preeminent scholar in
my field. Not being an expert did not deter me. Nor was I afraid of
being wrong---of which I have been countless times, both stylistically
and substantively. I admit to my faults. If I improved at all in the
process it is through trial and error: a baptism of fire. The mistakes
are integral to my growth as a person. I do not hide them, as they are
constitutive of who I currently am.

On the aforementioned spectrum, none of the extremes is better than
the other. I am not proud of my disposition. Again, no value
judgements. Mine is a descriptive statement of how things stand. I do
not prescribe it as the conduit to the blissful life.

The extremes on the spectrum represent complementary modes of
behaving. The same person can be situated on different parts of the
spectrum, depending on the specifics of the case, though they
generally are more on one side or the other. What matters is that we
appreciate the diversity among people, so as to not try to force
everyone to act the same way: all have their role in the social whole.

A competent leader figure, which may be a parent, teacher, football
coach, et cetera, knows whom to leave to their own devices and whose
hand to hold. A one-size-fits-all treatment is not only lazy and
misinformed but detrimental to those involved.

The desire for control is understandable and, depending on the
specifics, indispensable. The parent must be there to define the
boundaries within which the child can explore its world. What the
parent offers is effectively a robust framework of control, inside of
which there can be freedom. The child is thus empowered to employ its
faculties while being shielded from the most pernicious consequences.

Control loses its benign function as soon as it denies any space for
experimentation and failure. In the above example, the child can never
learn to trust its own devices if it is babied in the strictest of
ways. If it is not allowed to fall while trying to walk, then how will
it ever be prepared to deal with the far more painful hits that life
has in store for it?

What applies to individuals holds true for societies at-large. Those
that seek to maximise safety, else to monitor and regulate everything
down to the last detail, necessarily give rise to the tyranny of the
perceived known, which manifests as totalitarianism. At the other
extreme, those who deify the individual and see no need for
constraints whatsoever, such as through tradition that has stood the
test of time for millennia, usher in the tyranny of the perceived
unknown, which is experienced as ochlocracy and which shifts rapidly
from one fad to another.

The desire for control is what protects the baby, but also what kills
the latent hero in it. It is why we have to make efforts to understand
each other, not merely to tout how open-minded we are. Ignorance
cannot beget tolerance.

It will be another rainy day tomorrow. I am looking forward to it.
