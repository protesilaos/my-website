Sure, I will respond here and this will become the text of the blog
post (without disclosing your private information). I guess it makes
sense to do this as a video, but it will be difficult to do an
informative recording on my own where I show mirrors and stuff. Maybe
in the future...

I have been doing my own hair for a long time now. I first
experimented with it while I was a teenager. The hairstyles I do are
fairly simple, in that they do not involve a lot of detail-oriented
steps. I do not use scissors for my hair, though I do have them for
the beard if/when it is long (have not done that in a while, but I
might let it grow again this year).

The simplest hairstyle is the buzz cut. You take the electric clipper
and run it through your hair to create a uniform look. The way I make
sure that I catch everything is by placing the other hand in front, so
it guides the clipper. Using both hands ensures that you actually do
not need any mirrors. You rely on your sense of touch and continue
until you can no longer feel any hair that is longer than the rest.
Just make sure not to cut diagonally. Gently guide the blades on a
straight line, otherwise you will injure yourself. Also pay attention
to the angle of the blades: they should touch the skin from the size,
rather than vertically.

Another easy one is the clean shave. Start with a buzz cut to keep the
hair short and then use a razor to make a deeper cut. The razor I use
is the same I have for shaving. It is one of those generic ones you
find in stores with the 2 blades. There are other more renowned brands
with 3-5 blades, but I pick the cheaper option here because it is good
enough. To get the deepest cut, apply the razor counter to the
direction the hair grows towards. Make sure you are consistent though,
otherwise some spots will have a deeper cut than others. As with the
clipper, make sure not to run the razor diagonally: always move it in
a straight line

The other hairstyle I do which you linked to is a bit more involved,
in that I trim only the sides. For this I use two mirrors, one that is
framed on the wall and another that I hold in my hand. The exact curve
for the sides will depend on my mood, but the idea is to complement
the shape of the skull. The highest point I want to shave off is where
the top of the skull ends. It will depend on the shape of your head,
of course, but check if you can make a distinction between the upper
part of the skull and the sides. Imagine that a ball rolls from the
top: there must be a point where it meets the "cliff" and clearly
falls off. Then draw the line there. Once you are at this point, you
use the techniques that apply to the other two hairstyles I covered.

Clippers come with different guards for controlling the length of the
hair. Note that these can be false friends, because you must also be
mindful of the force you are applying. If you do rely on the guards,
be careful to maintain a steady hand and to be consistent throughout.
Otherwise the results will be uneven.

You may want to use such guards if you do a multi-level hairstyle
where the sides get progressively deeper from top to bottom. I have
done that before. The principles are the same. Using mirrors and keep
your hands steady.

With two mirrors, one inertial and another that you move around, you
can easily spot every side. Though you still have to get used to using
the tools while mirroring the motions. And then, you will need to
become sufficiently ambidextrous with them, as you cannot use the
right hand to cut deep on your left side and vice versa while also
maintaining a clear view through the mirror. This is the most
difficult part of the process, so you may want to practice with the
easier techniques before you get to this.

Something I also do while shaving/trimming my beard is to do the sides
first before moving to the centre. The idea is that if I run out of
battery or must leave quickly then I still have something that is
tolerable, if not already great. And if I planning to do the rest,
then I can work on it later.

Part of doing everything myself is to keep costs at a minimum. I do
not have fancy products, like lotions and stuff. I also never put
really hot water on my hair (actually I do cold showers year-round,
but this is just a me thing) or have a hair drier, so there never is
any related damage that has to be repaired. The hair stays healthy
thanks to the overall lifestyle. If you do need products though, then
that is fine: check online for suggestions, as I really am of no help
here.
