What follows is an excerpt from my journal.

* * *

A few minutes ago I threw away the last bucket of water. I stopped
counting after the tenth one. This was a long night with two phases of
heavy rainfall. It is past my bedtime and I do not feel sleepy
anymore. The flood control measures I have implemented around the hut
are working as expected. Though the building itself needs more work:
there are a few parts in the exterior of the walls' base that leak
water. I need a chisel to carve channels on the concrete floor. These
will direct the water away from the construction, preventing it from
accumulating adjacent to the walls.

The leaks are a known issue. The hut started off as a fair weather
edifice and I am reinforcing it over time ahead of the coming winter.
It could not have been done differently, given my limited resources. I
do not complain though. It is my shelter and the place I call "home".
I take this as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. This
tests my mettle and I am eager to continue.

Hardship breaks us. Though it can also make us more resilient. We do
not get to choose when it happens, nor what the prevailing conditions
will be. All we can hope for is that we have made the necessary
preparations to be physically and mentally ready for the challenge.

The puddles inside my house did not bother me. Nor was I dreading the
continuous rainfall. Nature will do its thing. The soil shall remain
fertile and the animals will continue living in their habitat. My
trees keep growing and I am happy to see them prosper. I have learnt
to be patient and to stay calm, while I recognise the reality of this
imperfect setup. Stressing about it does nothing but exacerbate the
problem. Dwelling on the past and complaining is pointless as well.
What has transpired is immutable. We can learn from it, though we
cannot undo it. There is no going back. All we can do is cope with the
present.

I keep going because I am not negative about my experience. The
momentary inconvenience I felt while dealing with the storm was but a
way to train myself to not take anything for granted. Here I witness
the phenomena without any filter. I am starting from the basics. I
thus recognise better than ever the unsung labour that goes into
keeping our communities in a more-or-less viable state. I understand
how we earn whatever we have access to. Not in the "American dream"
way of rationalising the appropriation of the commons and the
ever-expanding concentration of wealth in the hands of few, but in the
basic sense of admitting that life is not a walk in the amusement
park. We make it easier for ourselves with industry and perseverance.

It is trivial to say things. To tell everyone how it should be done or
how you would have done it. People are quick to offer their advice
without knowing you and/or without themselves living in accordance
with the precepts they purport to uphold. Never heed the words of
those who have not taken the time to consider your predicament. I hold
no respect for the person who talks big about their intellectual
acumen and moral integrity; the one who idly criticises others for the
mere fact of being imperfect. I only care about deeds and trust those
who embody what they say. It so happens that such people do not talk
much, because they know how difficult it is to proceed from ideation
to implementation. "What do you say to those who criticise such and
such?" Well, what are they doing about it?

Being reminded of hardship is helpful. It keeps us grounded in the
reality of the human condition. Unlike our romantic tales, nature has
love and conflict, attraction and repulsion, in equal measure. We have
to recognise our capacity for both. To survive is to resist the forces
that will otherwise undo our constitution. One can claim to be
all-loving from the comfort of their little empire, blithely ignoring
what went into its original formation and what contributes to its
ongoing maintenance. They will have to eat, to preserve their
presence, to struggle against entropy. However we go about it, nature
balances opposite forces.

Life is neither ugly nor beautiful; life is both ugly and beautiful.
No matter how we frame it, we live in the world of admixture. Pure
forms are analytical constructs that we formulate by abstracting away
from the particularities. The oneness of mind and body is an instance
of the cosmic admixture. While our thoughts can be about ideals, our
experiences are always incorporating the details we would otherwise
prefer not to deal with.

As I was throwing away a bucket of water, I walked a few meters
downhill towards the river. It was raining heavily, the wind was
strong, and the clouds were low in the valley. I could not see the
mountains in the distance. My skin could feel the cold, my ears were
hearing the motion all around, while my eyes were seeing the constant
flashes in the sky. The sheer force inherent to such phenomena can
kill any human. Yet it is what I found most invigorating and
enthralling in that moment. I sensed power flowing through every fibre
of my being. Never before have I felt so strong, so poised to act, so
determined to meet the challenge head on. Every birth involves pain
and tears. And so does every rebirth, every renewed commitment to
fight. Each time the soul is anabaptised, it is reminded of the
immanence of admixture, as it is given the impetus to keep going.

I do not complain. I am content with what I have. For as long as my
hands can wield tools, I will keep working hard to preserve my form,
to do what my condition renders inescapable. There may be a time of
plenty, of idleness, dissonance, and misplaced entitlement, where I
will be so bored as to seek controversies to give myself a sense of
conflict and adventure. Maybe I too will pontificate about the moral
high ground. In this timeline though, I remain calm in the knowledge
that whatever comes my way will go. The so-called good and the bad
will all be transfigured into something else, per the workings of the
cosmos.

I shall tend to my immediate needs. I do it in the same way a bird has
to fly, not due to insight into some higher purpose. I do not know the
ultimate "why". Tomorrow will be a sunny day, as will Monday. Once I
gather all the tools and materials I need, I will implement the
necessary measures. Maybe not this week, nor the one after. It does
not matter when. Who says it should be easy? I know what must be done
and I have the desire to do it. Thus I will improve my chances of
dealing with the heavy winter of these mountains. What happened here
is but a warm-up ahead of the real test. Nature gives, nature takes,
and we dance while we can. So be it!
