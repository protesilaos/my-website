This is an entry from my journal. It is a commentary on how people and
societies are, as well as some relevant words of introspection.

* * *

It is minutes past midnight. I woke up to the sound of fireworks and
the barking of my dogs. Now I cannot fall asleep. I am writing this to
express that which took form in my mind; that which will not allow me
to rest until I put it out there. Whenever there is a holiday or
special event, I am reminded of the fact that I am not like most
people around me. I do not share their sensitivities and they do not
share mine.

I do not feel superior or inferior to them. I simply am different.
What to me comes easily, to them is hard. And to what to them is
effortless, to me feels alien and distant. The fact that I live at the
margins of their society is ultimately not a choice of mine but the
result of natural differences made manifest over time. Like how there
is no mixing water with oil, no matter how forceful the blending is.

Society is an admixture of different types of people who are brought
together through acculturation. The culture we are immersed in
ultimately teaches us how to behave in each kind of situation. It is a
playbook, else a set of scripts, that we apply to evolving states of
affairs. Acculturation happens organically through imitation and
feedback loops that create positive or negative reinforcement. While I
was still in my homeland in Greece, for example, we would spend the
minutes after midnight of January 1st to write SMSs to everyone
wishing them a "Happy New Year" plus some personalised message. I did
it many times without thinking about it. Why? Because that is what
everybody was doing: it was _normal_ as in "that which most people do
by default" but also as "that which is expected of people to do".

I left Greece at the age of 18 and have not been back since.
Travelling and exposing myself to new milieux has had a profound
effect on me, which can be summarised as the end of the aforementioned
blending. It no longer applies to me or, at least, its power has
greatly diminished over the years. Everything started to feel
different, as I would interpret the world no longer as a mere
participant, but also as an observer. I became an outsider who was
somehow in the midst of events. Such is my conscience. My actions
acquired a dual nature of lived experiences and observational data.
Kind of "oh, look at me right now, writing an SMS to communicate
something formulaic; something that at best already covers what my
friend knows about me and which I continue to communicate through my
genuine attitude towards them".

Becoming a philosopher is a natural consequence of this underlying
arrangement of factors. I ask "why" and proceed to understand the
underpinnings of events. My character equips me to do so, especially
the independence I have always had. I do not ask anybody for
confirmation and seek no validation. If an idea stands to reason, I
will my make up my mind accordingly and act likewise. My
plainspokeness is a consequence of my eagerness to face up to whatever
authority. I do not hide behind elaborate language and esoteric
verbiage. In effect, I have the courage to say "this is as clear as my
ideas get and I have no fear to expound thus".

The underpinnings of character are predetermined. Environmental
factors amplify that which is latent. As a teenager I argued against
my teachers at school and openly mocked their "absurd" pretences to
authority. They could not pacify me and I refused to accept "because I
say so" as a valid answer. This was the philosopher in me before it
came to the fore as conscious behaviour. Why would I be any different
now that my powers have been augmented through continuous exposure to
the rigours of life?

Being an observer as well as a participant is not inherently
philosophical ("friend of wisdom" in the literal sense), let alone
wise. It is easy for this perception to underpin a judgemental outlook
or, worse, a sense of self-righteousness and elitism. Indeed, for a
little while until the age of 20 I was like that. I was lucky to not
cling on to my defined views and to ultimately remain dubitative and
inquisitive. It is how I grew out of that phase to become
contemplative and to withhold ultimate judgement.

Those who exhibit a huge ego have in them the potential to become
humble. They are not a lost cause. Though they do need to reach the
point of finding that which is greater than them and to recognise it
in earnest. In a sense, only once you succumb to a superior force do
you accept your place in the world. Ultimately, this is what we refer
to when speaking of the divine: the power that no man can force into
submission. Whether any given theology or school of thought is correct
is ultimately a distraction. What matters is the visceral understanding
one develops that there are magnitudes which are greater than their
individuality.

A metaphor I have for the different kinds of people is to liken them
to tools. Yes, this is simplistic, but is why we learn not to take
metaphors too seriously. The point is that there is no such thing as
the best tool. Each is appropriate for a specific task or in a given
situation. For example, when we need to rest, a comfortable bed is
better than an anvil. To cut down wild vegetation we need a sharp
blade rather than a hammer. And so on. I too am a specialised tool. A
sword, if you will.

I know my strengths and admit to my weaknesses. I cannot, for example,
be the heart of the party. More generally, I will never be the right
person to perform the functions of social reproduction, i.e. of
bringing people together and of ensuring that values are preserved
through yet more acculturation. I excel at opening paths and
introducing new possibilities. In physical terms, I literally go where
others fear to tread. For those tasks I am a one man army and feel
inexorable. It is no coincidence that the hut project is a thing: to
go beyond built-up areas, to pacify wild land, to work laboriously for
what others take for granted, and to ultimately make a decent living
that continues to improve over the months through my incessant work.
The intellectual side is no different: I am eager to entertain ideas
and will challenge anybody, no matter their standing, if I think I
have something else to say. More broadly, I have the audacity to
examine, which is again a metaphor of going where others dare not to
be.

Like all tools, my skills are not better than those of others. What I
do best is complementary to instances of social reproduction. A
society needs people like me who will identify open vistas and map the
horizons; people who will not conform with the status quo exactly
because they feel an irresistible urge for adventure and the
discoveries it may bring about. There is a part to us as a species
that is concerned with staying back to work with what we have and then
another part which is eager to take risks and rise up to any monster.
A society thrives when it can accommodate both extremes of the
spectrum and their permutations, which I may schematically represent
as the modes of preservation and exploration. One could liken those to
the archetypical feminine and masculine, but I find that such
metaphors are ultimately misleading, while they beget avoidable
role-playing and virtue signalling.

Societies oscillate between those modes throughout their history,
depending on their material conditions. When they feel emboldened to
experiment, such as during an economic boom, they reach out to do
commerce with people in foreign lands and are receptive to novel
thoughts. Conversely, when societies are gripped by fear, like during
an economic downturn, they fall back to what they perceive as their
baseline and become sceptical of others. Their reflex is to hesitate
and to stay back. It is why an economic crisis transmogrifies into a
crisis of values. Such is the dynamic between preservation and
exploration. Those correspond to "conservative" and "progressive"
outlooks, respectively, though not in their political sense as
ideologies but in their basic expression as modes of behaviour: to
retain and to keep risks at a minimum versus to risk virtually
everything for the sake of gaining more in the end.

There is no inherently superior paradigm that works optimally no
matter the prevailing conditions. Optimality exists within constraints
or given specific parameters. There is no such thing in abstract.
Those who believe that their mode is the only viable or beneficial way
ultimately stand at an extreme position. It is how one inflates their
ego: they believe that they represent the best there is, else that
which is inherently superior to others. Once we understand people as
tools, each with its scope of application, such an egoistic thought
clearly stands as misguided.

Societies that operate too far in either end of the
preservation-exploration spectrum lose their edge. If they explore too
much, they fail to do the groundwork of establishing unassailable
norms, and of having a modicum of stability that contributes to
predictability and thus peace. In effect, too much exploration is the
equivalent of experiences that are a mile long and a millimetre deep.
At the other extreme, a society that is preoccupied with just
preserving what it has does not keep up with the demands of life, such
as through technological innovation to accommodate growing material
needs. Too much emphasis on values, for example, as in a theocracy
ultimately means that there is prevalent fear and hesitation to think
outside the box.

Societies are organisms in the same way an individual human being is.
Just like with individuals, a society that is not working towards
something greater than what it has is lacking an inertial frame of
reference, else the lodestar in the sky. It cannot orient itself and
has no built-in sensor for when it is going off track. When people I
talk to share with me their frustration and sense of feeling lost, I
encourage them to think in terms of what is their mission in life:
what is the grand goal you are working towards? By this, I do not mean
mere wishes that we make frivolously, but actual commitments and thus
projects that are realisable and we are actively engaged in. Those who
are not working towards something great are, fundamentally, not
content with their life. This is because absent the fixed star in the
heavens, they easily get lost in trivial things. Their inevitable
inconsistency undermines their confidence. In the end, they
rationalise their inertia as inherent inability to act.

I do not try to persuade people to be like me because I understand
that this is not a viable social order. We need diversity of skills
and perspectives. I share all my works in freedom, hoping that
somebody will find them useful. Though I understand that I will never
be a pole of attraction for a community. In effect, my path is that of
loneliness. Such is the fate allotted to me and I have accepted it. I
am thus empowered to work to the best of my abilities and to not feel
the need to fit into some mould. There is no such distraction, no
resentment or grief, no pressure to become another, and no stress
whatsoever.

Some people, men to be specific, have asked me how it is to live the
way I do. I explain that it ultimately is not a choice. You either
accept who you are or suffer indefinitely from the mismatch between
the norms you have internalised and the reality you are experiencing.
I can live this way because, at my core, I am capable of it. And I do
so since everything else did not make me happy. I tried for a while to
fit in by suppressing my natural adventurer, or the untamed force
within, only to feel miserable and broken. If I ever find a wife, it
will have to be someone who essentially is like me or, at the very
least, does not make the mistake of trying to control me: there is no
taming the wolf within. Not only is such a woman rare in global terms,
it is extremely unlikely that one exists within the confines of my
locality and is even looking towards my general direction. In
practice, this is a numbers game that I cannot win.

I thus tell men who ask me about such topics to be yourself: do not
pursue something that looks fancy stylistically. I understand the lure
of adventure and I know how it is to feel a burning passion for
challenge. And yes, I also recognise that some forms of living seem
more badass than others exactly because you observe the cool parts
while not dealing with any of the costs. The badass quality is
stylistic though and you will err lamentably if you choose according
to such a criterion.

If you cannot be contained, then you will have to free yourself from
whatever container you are in. Though know that there is no inherent
superiority in so doing. Forget about role-playing and looking cool.
The masculinity merchants who demand from you a certain way of living
are ultimately talking about their own self or are just shrewd and
unscrupulous businessmen who are taking advantage of you. Be who you
are, for all tools are useful. I am a lone wolf and a sword because
nature made me so. I never chose my character the way we do in video
games. Such is life and the diversity of our species.

On days like this I make the appropriate wishes to everybody I meet
even though I personally do not feel anything about those words. Happy
New Year it is!
