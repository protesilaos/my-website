This is an entry from my journal. I write about some immediate issues
I am dealing with and then comment on wider themes about not taking
things for granted.

* * *

Local time is past 21:00. I am writing this on the laptop. It still
has about 30% of the battery left. I got off the computer at around
18:00, when the electricity ran out. These days it is hard to keep up
with my email correspondence. During the day I need to do my online
meetings and maintain all the free software I have. There simply is
not enough daytime for everything. I spent two hours in the morning
just to bring the unread message count down to 4, only for it to rise
back to double digits.

When electricity is available throughout the day, it is easy to cope
with incoming emails because the workload gets distributed throughout
the day. Whereas it is mentally taxing to start the morning with the
digital equivalent of paperwork. And even if I put aside the willpower
it takes to do this task, there are mornings when I cannot commit to
it due to other responsibilities. At any rate, things will return to
normal once I get and install the new battery for my solar panels. I
expect it to happen in a couple of weeks or so. The long wait is
almost over.

A strength of mine, which is probably a weakness too, is that I do not
chill. When there is idle time, I will come up with a job to keep me
busy and I will do it in earnest. Or I will go for a long hike, which
is not exactly what people mean by "chilling", anyway. At 18:00 it was
already night outside, yet I decided to resume the infrastructure
project I am currently working on. It is about placing large stones at
the perimeter of my land in an attempt to inhibit soil erosion caused
by rainfall. I was encouraged to do this at night because the
near-full moon was out. I could see clearly. Otherwise I would not
have taken the risk. When the moon is full, its rise roughly coincides
with the sunset.

The drought continues. October went by with a single day of
precipitation. That was a blessing, as we had not had rainfall since
the early Spring days. But it does not suffice. The dry soil is prone
to erosion as there is not enough vegetation to hold the surface
together. The most common grass we encounter practically everywhere
prevents a lot of damage. Absent that, these rocks are meant to
perform the same function. I dig around the edges and place each stone
in such a way as to turn whatever tiny water flow inwardly. No
realistic level of precipitation will ever cause any issues. The
objective is to not allow the formation of slides, which eventually
turn into fissures.

The rocks are but a piece to the puzzle. I am expecting at least some
grass to grow around them and get tangled up with them, at which point
my makeshift perimetric alignment of stones will become virtually
unbreakable. Whatever irrigation water I can spare will go this cause.
I have done this before with the land adjacent to the stream, where I
placed all sorts of obstacles and then waited for wild vegetation as
well as the canes I had transplanted to do the rest. In short, I can
now sleep safe in the knowledge that the threat of floods washing away
my land is practically nullified.

I am sourcing the stones from the surrounding area. There are plenty
of them in the mountains. I roam around with the handcart and pick up
as many as I can. Sometimes I find really large boulders, which are
extra useful for my purposes owning to their greater bulk and height
(e.g. 40 centimetres). They are practically immovable. A few carefully
places boulders can greatly reinforce my infrastructure. Plus, they
look nice in alignment. I call this "Cyclopic masonry", even though it
is not a fortification per se (nor are the slabs as large as what the
Mycenaeans had).

A boulder I brought into my land tonight was so heavy that I could not
lift it off the ground to put it into the handcart. I had to lean the
handcart to the side, roll the boulder in, hold it in place, and then
lift both up with some leverage---an extra difficult and dangerous
endeavour. Pushing that massive chunk of rock uphill was another major
challenge. I had to take a few breaks but I did not give up. Once I
brought the boulder close enough, I rolled it little by little to the
exact spot I wanted it to be. Mission accomplished!

Pushing and pulling heavy weights around the mountains demands
dedication. The terrain is uneven. Whenever there is a bump or minor
turn the hands suffer from the extra tension as you have to put every
ounce of strength into keeping your balance. To lose one's balance in
this situation is risky business. In the good scenario, the rocks will
fall to the ground and you will spend a few extra minutes collecting
them all again. Each weighs several kilos. In the bad scenario, you
get seriously hurt. Manual labour does not require a lot of planning
and thinking the way many office jobs do, though your safety is a
function of your levels of concentration. Be absentminded and you
shall get injured.

I remember the first summer I did construction work. I was studying at
the university back then. I would carry heavy burdens like those I did
today. Except that the unforgiving July sun was high in the sky. Not
only was it physically painful, I had to remind myself why I was doing
this. Otherwise I would not have had the mental fortitude to
persevere. The job was paying handsomely and I needed the money to
finance another semester of studies. This is not what people have in
mind when they talk about "student life". It is what I was doing
though.

Construction work was never fun. I kept at it by reminding myself of
the greater goal: to proceed with my studies. I find that it helps me
to keep things in perspective, else I might develop tunnel vision. It
also is benign to have a grand objective in mind, for it functions as
the lodestar in the sky that orients you in moments of doubt. The hut
project is the same in this regard. I know what I am setting up here
and thus all the intermediate difficulties do not deter me. I am
inexorable because my goal is clear and my commitment to it is devoid
of doubt.

Whenever I exert my body to see through these physically demanding
tasks, I draw strength from my longer-term vision. It does not make me
superhuman, though it empowers me to not fool around. I am not
ambivalent about it. My poise is perfect. I am not trying to negotiate
with myself some exit clause, some "cheat day", as it were. No. I am
not asking; I am telling: I have to do it and shall do it. Then, when
I look back at what I have achieved in my homestead and how this is
becoming a beautiful rural house, I find solace in the knowledge of
the originary struggle of acculturation. I know that nothing can be
built without vigorous efforts and nothing can be sustained without
intensity.

The Greek national anthem has this verse in reference to liberty,
which I am hereby translating faithfully:

```
I know you [liberty] from the cutting edge
of the sword, the mighty [the mighty cutting edge]
I know you from the sight
that paces the land with violence [with haste and with violence]
```

Violence is a misunderstood term because people take their culture for
granted. Just love and be happy is the common talking point. Sounds
pretty and cute, until you think it through. These people do not
realise that what holds a community or civilisation together, indeed,
what gives it its impetus and endows it with rejuvenating qualities,
is the eagerness to combat other forms of life and to struggle against
inertia. Individuals and cultures that become complacent experience
decline and are ultimately consigned to oblivion. Even love is
exclusive and uncompromising. Not some hippie conception of love, but
the everyday form that allows us to even be here. For example,
motherly love for a baby involves extreme prejudice against potential
threats, such as venomous snakes and poisonous spiders. It demands a
safe environment where there is no disease, no vectors of attack, no
unknown quantities. In love there is an inherent requirement to have
situational awareness, to measure the place with decisiveness, and to
mould your immediate milieu to fit your needs.

Not everybody needs to be extra alert and unyielding. That sort of
prescription is untenable. One size does not fit all and we do not
benefit from role-playing fashions to conform with some arbitrary
directive. "Be a man!"... Such empty words or an exhortation for a
certain kind of consumerism. All we need is to learn to tolerate those
among us who have the natural inclination to do the groundwork
(figuratively and literally in my case). You cannot be another. You
may only accept what your condition renders inescapable.

I remember when teenage me was sent to the principal time and again
because I was unruly, would brazenly leave my books under my desk,
never do any homework, talk back to my professors and mock them when
they appealed to their authority, and even showed them the middle
finger when they insisted. In hindsight, the principal was a wise man
because he understood that I was not a criminal element, but only
somebody who sought a different challenge. School was incredibly dull
and I did not accept sitting quiet for 8 hours straight and then
parroting whatever the teacher wanted to hear. Some people can operate
this way, which is useful for concerted actions and a harmonious
coexistence. I speak my mind boldly and stand my ground
unapologetically, which is also necessary in small doses to not fool
ourselves in our little echo chambers. Some people thrive in a
controlled environment. Others seek openendedness, since it is the
only inexhaustible outlet for their energy. Nature is taking care of
the distribution of these proclivities. We figure out how to not be
judgemental about them.

The principal said to the council "Protesilaos is a lost cause when it
comes to schooling, but he is *philotimos*." The word "philotimos"
stands for "friend of honour". The principal saw a pro-social quality
that would remain central despite my disobedience. An idiot of a
principal, the kind of bureaucrat who hides behind the letter of the
law, would have made an enemy out of me or had asked to diagnose me
with whatever condition inconsiderate doctors are inventing for
teenage boys nowadays because they cannot fathom the creative
potential of innate exuberance. This is the social equivalent of
remaining a prisoner of your comfort zone. It is how societies lose
their edge. You have to let people go where nobody treads. This is how
we push the boundaries and remain vigilant.

I am not inherently unruly. If I say something, I do it. There is no
reneging on my promises. But also, I do not talk big and promise much.
My word is my contract. What I did at school (and not only) was to
resist heteronomy, namely to be ruled by others on grounds that appear
to me as arbitrary. I have autonomy, in the dual sense of "self" and
of "rule", as I conform with my own dictates, expect consistency, and
accept the consequences of my actions. This is discipline. It is what
keeps my attention fixed on my projects through thick and thin.

The boulders are in place because I have a grand plan of how
everything fits together. At its basis is my eagerness to proceed
through compounding deeds. Tomorrow I will carry more stones. Another
moonrise will light my path and I will be ready to experience it.
