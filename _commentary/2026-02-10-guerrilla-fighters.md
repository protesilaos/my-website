This is an entry from my journal. I comment on how I do not try to
control people's impression of me.

* * *

Yesterday morning two labourers came to work at the neighbouring
vineyard. Their task was to prune the grapevines. I had to bring the
puppies indoors because they are still too eager to defend their
territory. The older dogs know when to fight and when to keep a
watchful eye. But the puppies lack experience. They need more time to
learn when they need to show ferocity and when to hold back. Usually
the latter is enough of a deterrent. I am training them little by
little and am confident that they will become competent guard dogs.
The key is patience: I cannot force things to happen.

At noon the labourers took a lunch break. I went to greet them. My
goal was to have a chat in order to learn more about what it takes to
manage a vineyard. The labourers are foreigners. They could barely
communicate in Greek. English was not much of an improvement either.
They told me that their employer was nearby, a couple hundred metres
further up the valley. I thanked them for the hint and went to meet
this person. He is a local. His name starts with "A", so for the
purposes of this article I will call him "Mr. A".

Mr. A is in his mid-sixties. I wanted to ask him about the best time
to plant new grapevines. My previous attempts have been unsuccessful.
He said that the droughts have been harsh and that I should try again
this year. Even in March is a good time. What matters is that there is
enough humidity and/or rainfall for the first couple of years. If
necessary, I should water them a little bit. The grapevines do not
need to be watered further once they grow enough. It is only necessary
to prune them, which I already know how to do properly.

He then asked me if I am the "guy with the dogs", to which I answered
affirmatively. There are plenty of people in my area who have a dog at
home, but I am one of the few, if not the only one, who consistently
walks around with dogs. Plus, I have four of them now and they are
medium-to-large animals. People will often ask me how do I handle four
dogs when even one is already a challenge, regardless of size. I
explain that it is not magic. If you put in the time to train them
properly and remain consistent in your verbal and non-verbal
communication with them, then you get the desired results. Being able
to physically handle four dogs is important, of course, though good
manners make everything easier.

Mr. A went on to tell me his story. He did most of the talking. "I am
a guerrilla like you", he said "I built my own house beyond the
built-up areas, installed solar panels there, and now need to have
dogs to guard the place while I am away". I thought likening us to
guerrilla fighters was a figure of speech that did not carry any
weight, but he continued down that line of thought: "we fight to the
bitter end", he added. I was maintaining eye contact while listening.
What I saw was indeed a fighter, but also a man with deep regrets who
was trying to set in motion what he kept postponing for a lifetime. I
felt that he was trying to muster the courage to wish something into
being rather than merely describe his condition.

I offered to help him with anything he needs for his homestead. As for
his impression of me, I made no comment. I let people speak their
mind. I do not try to correct them, nor do I wish to elicit favourable
opinions. If somebody says something about me, I take it as-is. I am
curious to understand their point of view, though I do not question
the merits of their position. The reason is that one's impression of
me may be inaccurate from my perspective but is not wrong from theirs.
What they have developed up until that point is a function of what
they are aware of and the circumstances of their being. Their opinion,
to the extent that they are honest about it, is a true reflection of a
certain state of affairs. Whether that aligns with the facts of my
life, let alone how I perceive of them, is a matter of correspondence
between data sets and attendant judgement calls.

Concretely, I was reluctant to commit to the notion that I am a
guerrilla fighter. I do not think of myself as fighting against
anyone. To my mind, I am but an ordinary villager. I live peacefully
in a rural area, doing much of what people used to do for millennia.
My life is quiet here. When I am not working on the computer, I spend
time with my dogs and/or do manual labour for my house/land. I tend to
all my projects with care and, generally, mind my business without
interfering in the affairs of others.

I know that my lifestyle is nothing special because this is how my
parents grew up. Their parents were peasants as well and so on for all
previous generations that we have records of. Same for their relatives
and neighbours. It is not until the second half of the 20th century
when everyone started treating rural life as démodé.

I live here because it appeals to me. I am not interested in starting
a mimetic trend. I think those quickly get overtaken by shallow
gimmicks, like with the so-called "trad" wives who bake bread in their
cute pink ovens while wearing a ton of makeup and the finest clothes.
My relatives, say my grandmother, was an actually traditional
matriarch who would have had some stern words for this show... But I
digress. My point is that I just do my thing, as I am not fishing for
Internet points.

How I became suspicious of the urban life I had is due to serendipity.
One day I stumbled across a 4-hour-long music video that emulated
natural sounds to induce a state of "deep focus and relaxation". You
hear the water flowing, the wind blowing, the birds chirping, and are
supposed to be empowered to act or, simply, to fall asleep easily. To
me, this presented an intellectual challenge: if the natural rhythms
have a benign effect on me, and if the baseline of what I experience
daily is to my detriment, then why do I not reverse the dynamic?
Instead of escaping from stress to find moments of tranquillity, I can
operate in a calm environment and engage in high-intensity activities
on demand.

Those videos can never address the underlying problems. They
effectively wanted me to experience an aspect of the world through a
proxy. Instead of going out there to get a feel for how it is, I was
invited to sit in front of the computer for several more hours,
indulging in my sense of comfort. What would I be doing in the
meantime, if not to aimlessly consume more "content"? That seemed
unhelpful to me. It took me a while to understand what had to be done,
but I already knew what the right direction was for me. I had to
change my ways, to scrutinise those activities that I had not put any
thought into, and to become someone I would be happy with. Since then
I decided to partake in the world without intermediaries and to live a
life of initiative.

Videos of natural sounds can never capture the complete experience
because there is no sense of danger or discomfort. If I am in the
middle of some unfamiliar forest after the sun sets, then my alertness
is at its maximum. Something primal awakens, which makes me a wolf
among wolves. In those moments, I am not my usual self because I
viscerally understand that the world is not necessarily kind to me.
The cosmos has no favourites. The world at-large does not revolve
around me. It does not care if I live or die, if I am happy or
miserable. In this world I find pleasure and grief. What prevails is
an equilibrium. I then feel in every fibre of my being how I have to
struggle for whatever it is I want to change. To try to the best of my
abilities for as long as those last, because the universe will not
conspire in my favour.

Mr. A is implicitly spot on about a certain behavioural trait: the
inclination to put ideas into action. This I do have and am much more
decisive than I used to be. It is inherently risky to make decisions
with far-reaching implications. There is a chance that you are wrong
and there is no way to get compensated for the lost vitality or the
years that went by. But how can we ever know if we do not put thoughts
to the test? I collect as much information as I can to inform my
judgement. When the answer is not clear and I am pressed to make a
decision, I let my gut feeling be the tie-breaker.

Ikaros (Icarus) took his flight too close to the sun. In a sense, his
was an act of hubris, of trying to escape from the confines imposed on
the human condition by the gods. His death was the price he had to pay
for such insolence. Though I think of Ikaros as a hero who dared to
push against the boundaries in order to discover where the terminus
is. Some people have this trait of not listening to words of caution.
They only submit to the authority of facts and reason. Everything else
is an opinion whose relevance remains to be determined. Conventional
wisdom fails to amuse them. They heed the song of the siren, which
lures them to the high seas where adventure, treasure, and death,
stand side-by-side.

Mr. A praised my integrity. I do not know what made his say that. I
barely talked, anyway. All I did was to seek advice about grapes and
to then pay attention to his instructions. What I said about myself
was limited to my name: "Protesilaos". Perhaps he meant to thank me
for what I had communicated through my deeds and body language: a
fight is possible and its outcome is not a given. Those who give up
lose before they start. In this regard, Mr. A may be on to something
with his metaphor. Though I still choose to believe that my uneventful
life in these mountains is not an open conflict with some rapacious
establishment, but a mere appreciation of the basics.
