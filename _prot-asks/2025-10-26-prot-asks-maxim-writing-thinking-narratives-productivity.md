In this 2-hour video, I talk with Maxim about the themes of writing
 and thinking, as well as productivity at-large. Maxim is a professor
 of linguistics at a university in Russia. He has a PhD in philology.

The first point of interest we cover is Emacs. Maxim uses Emacs for
taking notes, keeping track of tasks, and staying organised. Part of
this workflow involves the org-roam package, which is an excellent
tool for maintaining a note-taking system. The other part is the Org
agenda, which in Maxim's case helps maintain a macro view of the
ongoing projects.

I then ask about Maxim's work and learn about the distinction between
linguistics and philology. In this context we discuss attitudes
towards reading and writing. We explore how the education system
assumes that if you are a local you already are competent in the local
tongue, which is not necessarily true. Maxim teaches "effective
writing", which we explore in some further depth.

One of the topics we delve into is about the benefits of writing. This
is about keeping a journal or publishing posts on a blog. I also share
my own experiences in this regard, as someone who publishes a lot.
Writing is a medium through which one may elucidate their thoughts and
thus understand their own ideas better.

A blog, in particular, is like journaling on hard mode. This is
because of the potential for criticism. We talk about what criticism
does, how to think of yourself as a writer/thinker, and ways to
approach phenomena such as trolling.

Throughout our exchange we make references to the human condition and
narratives. We discuss the function of dreams, of fiction, and about
learning from experiences that are not necessarily specific to the
facts of one's condition. Maxim tells me about his endeavours with
blogging as well as how he likes to follow the stories of athletes.

Another thread that runs through our talking points is that of
productivity and how it is important to keep one's own experience and
needs in perspective.
