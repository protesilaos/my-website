In this ~2.5-hour video, I talk to Christian Tietze about a wide range
of topics, from his indie and freelancing programming, to topics of
practical philosophy, and ultimately to note-taking with the
Zettelkasten method. I have known Christian from the Emacs community,
having interacted with him on several issue trackers (e.g. my
`modus-themes`). He also has a blog where he posts articles about
Emacs.

Throughout our chat, we make connections to matters of productivity,
focus, and commitment. Christian has a young daughter and this is a
fact that informs many of the issues we comment on.

In terms of philosophy, we explore the theme of what exactly do we
value in somebody's work. Is it the result or the work that goes into
developing the necessary skillset for such a result? This has wide
applications on everyday affairs. In this context, we also consider
the idea of experiencing as much of the world as possible, where we
comment on psychedelics and having the right attitude to do things
long-term.

With regard to Zettelkasten, Christian is one of the two people behind
the website zettelkasten.de, which is a high quality resource on
Zettelkasten. Christian shares information about the life of Niklas
Luhmann, the genius behind Zettelkasten, and expounds on how one's
notes contribute to a continuous process of discovery. We comment on
how the interplay between the person and their notes can give rise to
new thoughts.
