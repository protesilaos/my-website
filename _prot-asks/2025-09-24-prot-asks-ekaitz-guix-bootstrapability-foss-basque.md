In this video I talk to Ekaitz Zárraga, a free software engineer and
contributor to the Guix project, among others. I start by asking a few
basic questions about the background of Ekaitz and the way to becomig
a Guix contributor. We then talk in-depth about the work the Guix
project does to ensure that software is reproducible all the way down
to the compiler. I learn about the technicalities involved in this
endeavour and get a sense for how difficult the task of ensuring
bootstrapability is. Ekaitz makes this happen on the RISC-V processor,
which has its own set of challenges. Our next big topic is about the
work Ekaitz does in general, which includes the promotion of Free
Software. I learn about the specifics of those contributions, such as
how Ekaitz teaches various technical skills to people. We explore the
relevant insights one gets from knowing all the different needs and
sensitivies people have. In the final third of our exchange, I ask
Ekaitz about his homeland in the Basque country to get a feel for how
life is there, what is the history of the place, and what are some of
the current trends in their everyday life.
