In this near-3-hour video I talk to Eric Frederickson about a broad
range of issues that can be summed up under the theme of "cosmic
consistency". We start with a discussion about Eric's endeavours with
software development. I ask about Eric's experience with free software
and open source contributions, which makes us consider not just the
programming side of things but also how there is a community-building
component to the whole process. The development of GNU Emacs is a case
in point. We explore how participating in free software is part coding
part character building due to the social skills/interactions
involved.

Our next big topic is art and creativity. Eric is a musician and has a
keen interest in the artistic experience. Over the course of our talk
we comment on ways to be creative, the different forms of expression
we find from conservation to exploration, and how harmony is
experienced. Many finer points here involve the sense of awe, how
aesthetics cannot be reduced to words, that text alone disturbs us
because we do not connect to a person's emotional state, and more.
Eric asks me what I think about the rhythm of life, also with regard
to my way of choosing to live in the mountains and how all that
underpins my creativity.

We share how myths and catchy stimuli play a key role in religiosity,
as well as how religion cannot be reduced to a system of propositions:
it also has a social aspect to it and a function of social
reproduction. Our attention is focused on how people understand when
not to take themselves too seriously. Examples we expound on involve
Santa Claus and the Greek gods. In this regard I explain how Greek
religion and Greek mythology are distinct, even if the latter draws
inspiration from the former.

At many points we draw parallels between matters of human creation,
such as art, and the natural order. For example, there is a way in
which an idea stands the test of time when its application leads to
viable results.
