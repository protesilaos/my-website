In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-07-10-prot-asks-chats-videos-proposal/>.

In my 1-hour talk with Carlos, I learn more about how Emacs is used
for engineering in tandem with octave-mode. Another Emacs-related
topic is note-taking with Org and the use of LaTeX. At parts we talk
about scientific publishing and freely accessible knowledge. Some of
that relates to free/libre software and the values it has. We also
discuss general issues about life in Spain.
